Sure. Then as for now, "ti,am654-icss-iep" goes in the driver, I will keep the
dt binding compatible as below (as it was earlier in v1.)

- ti,am654-icss-iep   # for K3 AM65x, J721E and AM64x SoCs

When new SoCs are introduced I can add specific bindings for them with
"ti,am654-icss-iep" being the fallback.
