Which is cleared/set in the suspend/resume callbacks and they are called
from a work (the driver uses async runtime_get).

True, but still.

the autosuspend_delay is set 100 ms, so if you put a udelay(101) between
prep_sg and issue_pending in the usb driver this trickery will be for
nothing, right?
If the usb driver is preempted for longer than 100ms between the two
calls, same issue.
Not sure, but if for some reason the transfer would take longer than
100ms than pm_runtime will bring down the dma, no?

any of the prep callbacks kind of indicates that a client is preparing a
transfer so in a perfect world it is going to want to execute it..

Well, it would have the same issues. If the time between
dmaengine_be_warned_i_m_going_to_call_issue_pending_soon and
issue_pending is more than the autosuspend_delay then it is not going to
help.

On the other hand: if the usb driver assumes that the dma transfer is
already finished when issue_pending returned and carry on with
subsequent request, that is also a problematic assumption. One can only
consider a transfer to be done if the completion callback is called or
you have polled for the completion and it tells you the same.
This is problematic if you are in atomic context as the DMA completion
interrupt might not come while you are there.

imho, this fix is working by lucky constellation of the stars ;)
Or we can assume that there will never be more than 100ms delay between
prepare_sg and issue_pending...
