Yes and no.

For example the img4780 seems to need a clock reference in the
gpu node. But it could maybe connected in a parent node like recent
TI SoC do with the target-module approach.

And our goal is to end up with a common driver for all SoC and =
architectures
in far future. Then, probably clock, reset and power management should
be handled in the same way.

Ok.

Well, my concern as a regular .dts author is that I usually treat
bindings as documentation and giving hints how to write a .dts and
what to take care of. If it is not complete, I get into big trouble.

One says it needs a libyaml but after installing one my HOSTCC didn't =
find
it. The other asks for another script which seems to be missing.

Yes...

You see into what issues a first time YAML/schema writer with 35 years C =

YAML, Python or JSON experience runs into...

Writing bindings as .txt was easy :)
