No, data phase does not have be 8 clock cycles long. This is only true
in case of 1 bit mode where 8 clock cycles are required to transfer a
full byte. In case of Quad mode, only 4 clock cycles are enough to
transfer 2 bytes of data with WLEN set to 1 byte (FLEN or number of
words read should be even).

Have you tried setting WLEN = 1 in Quad mode? Did you see any issue with
that configuration?
