I've been rebooting often as I build new kernels with debug output but I
will do a test with 5.6 by leaving it running overnight and see if it gets
disrupted.  I use the PocketBeagle with the TechLab PocketCape [0] for
kernel development as there is no eMMC to confuse the boot sequence and
the TechLab has a seperate USB to serial converter so I can easily see
u-boot and kernel console.

I asked Robert Nelson if he'd heard of this issue and he had not.  But he
asked how you are powering the board as any blip would probably reset the
board instantly as not enough cap's on the PocketBeagle's USB power rail.

Thanks, that makes sense. 

But in this case, pinctrl-single also needs to parse "gpio-ranges"
property from the gpio nodes?

What woud it mean for the pinctrl-single to be configured for gpio
functionality?

Would that be needed for pinctrl_gpio_request() to succeed?

Wouldn't the pinctrl pin numbering be from 0 to pcs_device.size /
pcs_device.width ?  

That index number of the pin plus pcs_device would give the physical
address of the padconf register.
