We want to enable driver developers to choose one of two options for the
registration of Energy Model:
1. a simple one via dev_pm_opp_of_register_em(), which uses default
    callback function calculating power based on: voltage, freq
    and DT entry 'dynamic-power-coefficient' for each OPP
2. a more sophisticated, when driver provides callback function, which
   will be called from EM for each OPP to ask for related power;
   This interface could also be used by devices which relay not only
   on one source of 'voltage', i.e. manipulate body bias or have
   other controlling voltage for gates in the new 3D transistors. They
   might provide custom callback function in their cpufreq driver.
   This is used i.e. in cpufreq drivers which use firmware to get power,
   like scmi-cpufreq.c;

To meet this requirement the registration of EM is moved into cpufreq
drivers, not in the framework i.e cpufreq_online(). If we could limit
the support for only option 1. then we could move the registration
call into cpufreq framework and clean the cpufreq drivers.

Lukasz
