It is not about one company's idea to make the driver as a module. Linux kernel
community in general strongly encourages developers to build the drivers as
module unless there are exceptions (which I have already quoted). If you keep
building the drivers as built-in, it will result in a bloated kernel image. For
sure vendors would want *their* interested drivers to be built-in so that they
do not need to package the drivers in initramfs/rootfs, but that's not a
practice which is encouraged by the Linux community.

So I'm in favor of making the PCIe controllers as module if there are no
technical issues.
