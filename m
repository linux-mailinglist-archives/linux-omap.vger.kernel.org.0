If REFCLK is stable when clk_prepare_enable() returns, and we don't
start the msleep(PCIE_TPVPERL_MS) until then, it should be safe.  
Maybe mention T_PERST-CLK in a comment, e.g.,

  PCIe CEM r5.0, sec 2.2.1, requires both T_PVPERL (100ms) between
  power stable and PERST# inactive and T_PERST_CLK (100us) between
  REFCLK stable and PERST# inactive.  Starting the T_PVPERL delay
  after REFCLK is stable means that delay covers T_PERST_CLK as well.
