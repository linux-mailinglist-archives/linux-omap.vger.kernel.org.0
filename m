According to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/audio-graph-card.txt
it should be something like this:
&mcbsp3 {
        #sound-dai-cells = <0>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        pinctrl-0 = <&mcbsp3_pins>;
        status = "okay";

        ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
                port@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			cpu_dai3: endpoint@0 {
				dai-format = "dsp_a";
				frame-master = <&cpcap_audio_codec1>;
				bitclock-master = <&cpcap_audio_codec1>;
				remote-endpoint = <&cpcap_audio_codec1>;
			};

			cpu_dai_mdm: endpoint@1 {
				dai-format = "dsp_a";
				frame-master = <&cpcap_audio_codec1>;
				bitclock-master = <&cpcap_audio_codec1>;
				remote-endpoint = <&mot_mdm6600_audio_codec0>;
			};
		};
	};
};

If you span out dummy DAIs got dai1+ then how you will get anything
working via endpoint1+?
There will be no ops for McBSP, so it is not going to do anything...

The audio-graph-card.txt example shows pcm3168a which have two DAIs,
one for playback and one for capture.

I guess Morimoto-san can explain if he carries out of tree patches to
get the described setup working on top of mainline...

But, no, based on the documentation I don't ;)

That's an option, yes, if we really need extra dummy McBSP DAIs at all,
again, let's hear from Morimoto-san or Mark.

For some it should not be a big deal as they only boot in DT mode.
/me adds this to the TODO list.

Thanks!

I think I should put my droid4 out and try to get it working...
Do you have a link for dummies to follow to get started? ;)
