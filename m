So I think I've found now the right piece of documentation and a driver 
that implements something similar [1].

So I will write a similar driver like linked above that only sets the 
right bits for A83T and A31/A31s.
Do you think this is the right approach?

Looks like I looked in the wrong place and got some information that are 
not suitable for this.

Ok thanks! So I will resend my patches when the work got a more mature 
state and we know enough about the Hardware.
