Thanks for heads-up.

I had issue when I could not charge _empty_ droid4 battery from
powerbank. Green light was blinking and current was going up and down
but never stabilized. I thought I had dmesg from that but can't find
it now :-(.

Plus, I left D4 on charger overnight, and found battery empty in the
morning. It apparently charged in the evening but then discharged.

Best regards,
									Pavel
