Subject: [PATCHv2 0/4] Thermal fixes for omaps for single mode read

Hi all,

Here's v2 set of thermal fixes for single mode read. Turns out the
EOCZ and SOC bit handling is quite different between the various
SoCs.

With these changes we fix the following issues for reading a
single sample:

- Get rid of pointless register access and loops for dra7

- Fix omap3 to use proper timeouts, the current looping is
  way too short and always times out probably leading to
  bogus values as folks have reported

- Fix omap4430 where EOCZ only seems to work for continuous
  mode

Regards,

Tony

Changes since v1:
- Use better MODE_CONFIG checks as suggested by Peter
- Fix issues for omap3 as noted by Adam
- Fix handling for dra7

Tony Lindgren (4):
  thermal: ti-soc-thermal: Skip pointless register access for dra7
  thermal: ti-soc-thermal: Fix stuck sensor with continuous mode for
    4430
  thermal: ti-soc-thermal: Simplify polling with iopoll
  thermal: ti-soc-thermal: Use non-inverted define for omap4
