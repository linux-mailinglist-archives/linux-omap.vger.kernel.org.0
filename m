This is easily solvable. Just assert PERST# pin explicitly via
gpiod_set_value() call prior calling that sleep function. And it would
work whatever state that pin has at init time. This has advantage that
reader of that code does not need to do too much investigation to check
at which state is GPIO at probe time and what implication it has...

Some other driver are doing it too, e.g. pci-aardvark.c.

Due to fact that also bootloader may use PCIe bus (maybe not now, but in
future; like it happened with pci-aardvark after introducing boot
support from NVMe disks), initial state may change.

Lorenzo asked a good question how GPIO drives PERST#. And maybe it would
be a good idea to unify all pci controller drivers to use same GPIO
value for asserting PERST# pin. If it is possible. As we can see it is a
big mess.

Personally I would like to a see two helper functions like

  void pcie_assert_perst(struct gpio_desc *gpio);
  void pcie_deassert_perst(struct gpio_desc *gpio);

which pci controller driver will use and we will not more handle active
high / low state or polarity inversion and meditate if gpio set to zero
means assert or de-assert.
