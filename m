Okay, I'll add spin spin_lock_irqsave() in cdns_pcie_write_sz(). As you also
pointed below that delay for legacy interrupt is wrong and it has to be fixed
(with a later series).

How do you want to handle cdns_pcie_ep_fn_writew() now? Because now we are
changing the default implementation to perform only 32-bit access (used for
legacy interrupt, msi-x interrupt and while writing standard headers) and it's
not okay only for legacy interrupts for platforms other than TI.

So just for legacy interrupt, you want me to add a different accessor which
does not perform 32-bit writes (while we add a different .raise_irq for TI
platform?

You are right. This is wrong and it has to be fixed. I'll work on this later.

Thanks
