good point, thanks

Interesting, in the internal review Dietmar asked me to remove these two
functions. I had the same idea, which would simplify a bit the
registration and it does not need to check the dev->bus if it is CPU.

Unfortunately, we would need also two function in drivers/opp/of.c:
dev_pm_opp_of_register_cpu_em(policy->cpus);
and
dev_pm_opp_of_register_dev_em(dev);

Thus, I have created only one registration function, which you can see
in this patch set.

What do you think Dietmar?

Yes, I think you made a good point with this OPP dependency, which we
could avoid when we implement these two registration functions.

The policy mask is populated, our registration function is called at
the end of the init code of CPUfreq drivers. I will check this option.

Thank you for your comments.
