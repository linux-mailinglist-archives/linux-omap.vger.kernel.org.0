So this seems certain to collide badly with Mauro's RST-conversion monster
patch set.

More to the point, though...if we are going to thrash up things this
badly, we want to be sure that we're doing it right so we don't end up
renaming everything again.  Grouping stuff into a new arch/ subdirectory
adds a bit of order, but it doesn't do much toward trying to organize our
documentation for its readers, and it doesn't help us to modernize the
docs and get rid of the old, useless stuff.  A quick check shows that many
of these files have seen no changes other than typo fixes since the
beginning of the Git era.

So, in my mind, this needs some thought.  Maybe we want a
Documentation/arch in the end, but I'm not convinced that we should just
create it and fill it with a snow shovel.  This might be a good thing to
discuss at the kernel summit in September.

Thanks,

jon
