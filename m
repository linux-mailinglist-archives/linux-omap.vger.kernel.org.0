I would love to have feedback because, as said, I think my patch is
correct, but if I'm wrong (which might well be) I have to drop patch 1
and rewrite patch 2 in a slightly more complex form.

About your request to try: I only have hardware with phy_count==1, and
anyway I cannot access it at the moment. :(

Regards.
