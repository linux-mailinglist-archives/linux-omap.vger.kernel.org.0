So one patch for .c files and Makefile and other one for Kconfig.

I went through the email-thread you have shared.
It looks like its related to the issue when pcie bridge driver also 
working as a interrupt domain/controller for EP.
In case of legacy interrupt support, its required that pcie host driver 
free interrupt mapping before freeing the interrupt domain.

Note that current upstream implementation of pci-j721e doesn't support 
interrupt domain, so issue doesn't applies here but its there in TI 
kernel and I believe we are handling this in proper way by freeing the 
mappings before.

Also pci-j721e remove() was lacking some important clean-up functions 
including pci_remove_root_bus() without which remove wasn't possible, so 
added required calls and checked the correct sequence of calls.

I have tested load/un-load multiple times on J784S4 EVM PCIe1 instance, 
it worked fine but reload after load->un-load in case of j721e fails 
leading to kernel hung, I suspect this as something to do with improper 
(sequence) handling of refclk for endpoint (shutting down and then 
powering up) as the only difference between these is that for J784S4 
both host controller and EP side use shared ref-clk generated by pcie 
phy while in j721e case host controller use pcie-phy clock while EP side 
uses board generated ref-clock, so something to do with power and clock 
off/on sequence.
