I think we should find a way where we can keep the existing kernel
interface as all the apps rely on that. If we allow userspace to
optionally set the estimated battery full and battery empty coulomb
counter values we should be all set.

For temperature compensation it seems that the ocv-capacity-table
is the way to go to describe the battery if the battery data is
unsuable or does not exist.

Agreed, at minimum the userspace should save estimated coulomb
counter full and empty values. After that calculations are trivial
as seen with this series.

Well we do have that via IIO already. Not sure if that is needed
for power supply.
