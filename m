Right, but the xx variants are against the device tree naming and
that's why we should get rid of them in the dts. The compatible
should be named after the first instance like "ti,omap3430" and
similar devices can just use that.

Hmm right, yeah using soc_device_match() would remove this issue.
It might be worth doing as these SoC variants do not change
much and the code should not need updating. Up to you to
decide.

OK. Just limit the compatible changes to the ones that
need to be modified for this series, the rest can be
done with a separate patches.
