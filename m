If you really want to use it, first enable it for the battery in
/sys/class/power/supply/usb to allow it, then also enable it for the
charger in /sys/class/power/supply/usb to actually use it.

But as discussed earlier, it really seems the battery ages faster at
the higher charge rates. Especially if left connected to the charger
for longer times as also seen with Android earlier.

Right, we should now use the configured voltage :)

Hmm OK. Sounds like you might have some patches coming then?

Yeah no idea how that is handled. Also changing the battery can cause
issues with this. I was expecting the 1-wire EEPROM to contain some
battery specific data like a serial number, but it seems this data is
the same for all the same type batteries.

Maybe some charge counter offset limit can be used to validate
the saved data in the userspace before updating values for kernel?

Sounds good to me :)
