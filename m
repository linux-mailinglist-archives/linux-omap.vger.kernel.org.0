No one notices "deprecated" stuff, they only notice if the code is
removed.  So removing it is the only way to pay attention.

But why are out-of-tree changes needed?  If they are needed, why are
they not submitted for us to take so that it is usable by everyone?  Or
is the out-of-tree patches also not supposed to be used?
