I was referring to ioremapping 'reg' region.

Okay, that is clearer as to what the difference is. I think this
should be 2 patches. One dropping 'mem' usage and using a mask and the
2nd making the mask per platform.

Really, the parent node of the PCI controller should probably have
'ranges' and you could extract a mask from that. Looks like that is
what you had for DRA7... I'm not sure if ABI stability is important
for the Cadence platform. I'd assume that's just some IP eval system
and probably not?

Why do you need an ops here? All you need is a mask value.

So while you had the data for a mask in DT, the driver now hardcodes it?
