> By not making 'clocks' required you make it possible to create broken =
bindings; according to your schema, a GPU node without a 'clocks' for =
the JZ4780 would be perfectly valid.

Yes. But it will never pass a test with real hardware. So it can't be =
omitted anyways.

On a more general thought, this argument holds for any optional =
property. So it is not specific to clocks. Since the reg address values =
are also never specified you can still create broken bindings. Or by =
connecting the wrong clock. So the ways to create broken bindings are =
numerous.

I also assume that SGX integrators are not beginners and do you think =
they need to find out through a make dt_binding_check dtbs_check that =
they should define a clock? based on *assumptions* we do without having =
access to all systems?

IMHO the bindings documentation is a documentation. So it needs to be =
helpful but not perfect. Formalizing all corner cases in a bindings =
document (just because we can since .yaml was introduced) is IMHO =
overkill.

In times before the introduction of more formal .yaml I think we would =
not even have considered this for a comment in the bindings.txt.

> It's possible to forbid the presence of the 'clocks' property on some =
implementations, and require it on others.

To be precise we have to specify the exact number of clocks (between 0 =
and 4) for every architecture.

This also contradicts my dream to get rid of the architecture specific =
components in the long run. My dream (because I can't tell how it can be =
done) is that we can one day develop something which just needs =
compatible =3D img,530 or imp,540 or img,544. Then we can't make the =
number clocks depend on the implementation any more.

> See how it's done for instance on =
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/samsung_uart.yaml.

Yes I know the design pattern, but I wonder if such a move makes the =
whole thing even less maintainable.

Assume we have finished DTS for some SoC. Then these DTS have been =
tested on real hardware and are working. Clocks are there where needed =
and missing where not. We may now forbid or not forbid them for some =
implementations in the bindings.yaml but the result of dtbs_check won't =
change! Because they are tested and working and the bindings.yaml has =
been adapted to the result. So we have just duplicated something for no =
practical benefit.

Next, assume there is coming support for more and more new SoC. Then, =
developers not only have to figure out which clocks they need in the DTS =
but they also have to add a patch to the implementation specific part of =
the bindings.yaml to clearly define exactly the same what they already =
have written into their .dts (the clocks are either there for the =
of_node or they are not). So again the rules are for no benefit, since a =
new SoC is introduced exactly once. And tested if it works. And if it is =
there, it will stay as it is. It is just work for maintainers to review =
that patch as well.

It boils down to the question if we need to formalize the rule how a =
working DTS was derived. Or just have a working DTS and not formalize =
everything.

So IMHO carrying along such a detail (forbid clocks on some =
architectures) is nice to have (and fun to learn the .yaml thing) but =
not of benefit for anyone. Not for the DTS developer nor for the =
maintainers nor for the users of a Linux kernel. "Keep it simple" is =
always a good rule for maintainability.

In summary I don't see a good reason to follow this in v8. But you could =
add it by a separate patch later if the DTS have been reviewed and =
agreed.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
