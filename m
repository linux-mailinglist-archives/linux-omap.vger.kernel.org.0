As we said before, the number of clocks is a property of the GPU and=20
*not* its integration into the SoC.

So you would *not* have a number of clocks between 0 and 4. You get=20
either 0, or 4, depending on whether or not you have a wrapper.

If you add support for a new SoC, you'd still need to modify the=20
binding to add the compatible string. So the argument of "more work" is=20
moot.
