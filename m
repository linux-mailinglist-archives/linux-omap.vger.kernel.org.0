That issue only prevents more than 5 pci-endpoint-test devices to be
tested simultaneously.

For the GIC ITS issue, I'm planning to post the workaround mentioned in
the errata document.

Errata ID #i2101 GIC: ITS Misbehavior
(https://www.ti.com/lit/er/sprz455a/sprz455a.pdf).

Also the GIC ITS issue is not present in J7200 and AM64 which this
series is planning to address. It's present only in J721E and AM65.

Thanks
Kishon
