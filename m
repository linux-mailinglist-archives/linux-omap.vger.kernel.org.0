Citing tps65950 trm page 55:

The device contains three switch-mode power supplies (SMPS):
=E2=80=A2 VDD1: 1.2-A, buck DC/DC converter (VOUT =3D 0.6 V to 1.45 V, in s=
teps of 12.5 mV)
=E2=80=A2 VDD2: 600-mA buck DC/DC converter (VOUT =3D 0.6 V to 1.45 V, in s=
teps of 12.5 mV, and 1.5 V as a
   single programmable value)

you are right, they are not really continuous. So should I add these
68 steps they have as a voltage list?

I think they are nearly continuous, so we should IMHO rather take that
not that strict. I guess there are no really continuous regulators, all
have steps as voltage is specified in a limited resolution. So what is
the exact meaning of that flag here?

I think it is common sense to specify these regulators as continuous.
Max and min values are already in arch/arm/boot/dts/twl4030.dtsi.

Andreas
