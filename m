Maybe we can nicely ask them?

I expect Paul Burton to have some contacts at ImgTec. Asking for a doc=20
would be too much, but maybe they can help a bit with the DT bindings.

Well, I expected all SGX versions to have 4 clocks.

If some SGX versions have 3 clocks, and others have 4 clocks, it's=20
still OK as long as the number of clocks is enforced, so that all=20
implementations of a given SGX core will have to use the same number of=20
clocks.

About the wrapper... I don't really know how it's done there. But you=20
could very well pass all clocks unconditionally to the SGX node, even=20
if it's inside a wrapper.
The wrapper itself probably needs only one clock, the one that allows=20
it to access its registers.

You have a new SoC with a SGX, and you only need to enable one clock to=20
get it to work. So you create a devicetree node which receives only one=20
clock.

Turns out, that the bootloader was enabling the other 3 clocks, and=20
since the last release, it doesn't anymore. You're left with having to=20
support a broken devicetree.

That's the kind of problem that can be easily avoided by enforcing the=20
number of clocks that have to be provided.

What's wrong with having the SoC name in the compatible string?

You cannot use just a "img,sgx544" compatible string, as then you would=20
assume that the same SGX version in (e.g.) an Ingenic or a Omap SoC is=20
the exact same. This may actually be true. But the moment you discover=20
even a tiny thing that needs to be handled differently, you wouldn't=20
have the possibility to do so.

That's what I tried to explain above. You'd be able to get the SGX to=20
work without a single clock in devicetree. That doesn't mean it should=20
be allowed.
