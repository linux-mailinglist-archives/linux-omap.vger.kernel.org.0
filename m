First of all, my apology for the long delay in answering / commenting on this.
Second, Cc'ed to Ilpo.

I'm a bit off of the UART work nowadays, but luckily we have Ilpo who is
pretty much ramped up on the topic. Please, include him in all your work
WRT 8250 UART improvements. I hope Ilpo might have time to test the patch
mentioned in this message or give an idea how to do better, if possibly.
