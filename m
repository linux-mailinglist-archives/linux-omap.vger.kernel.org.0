Hmm OK so I think we need fck at both the module level and qspi level.

Yes you can configure both fck and ick there, and also additional
clocks. But the clkctrl clock is the fck clock gate for this module,
and it's source can be the same as the interface clock for some
modules.

When I sent the experimental patch I confirmed that just the fck
as <&l3s_clkctrl AM4_L3S_QSPI_CLKCTRL 0>, ti-sysc.c driver can
read the qspi module revision register just fine. So that means
that it's enough for the module, and the spi_clk is another
clock specific to the child qspi IP in the module.

So based on that, I think we should set up the clocks in the
following way for the module and it's qspi child:

target-module@47900000 {
	...
	clocks = <&l3s_clkctrl AM4_L3S_QSPI_CLKCTRL 0>;
	clock-names = "fck";
	...

	qspi: spi@0 {
		...
		clocks = <&dpll_per_m2_div4_ck>;
		clock-names = "fck";
		...
	};
};

That way the qspi driver can set the divider on it's fck based
on "spi-max-frequency" dts property.

Yeah so that's <&l3s_clkctrl AM4_L3S_QSPI_CLKCTRL 0> for
am437x.

Well can test again with the patch below to see if that is
enough to make it work :)
