OK. Having the serial controller be the parent device for the port device
will make runtime PM work as designed :)

The controllers are devices already probed by the serial port drivers.
What's missing is mapping the ports (as devices based on the comments
above) to the controller devices. I don't think we need another struct
device for the serial controller in addition to the serial port driver
device and it's child port devices.

Yes so it seems.
