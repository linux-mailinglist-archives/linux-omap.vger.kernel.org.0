Point taken but regardless this deviates from the PCI electromechanical
specifications (ie T-PERST-CLK), does not it ? I misused "platform" to
define something that apparently is not contemplated by the PCI
specifications (and I would like to understand why).
 
I guess on ACPI systems (ie where the PERST# handling is implemented in
FW) this is handled in BIOS/UEFI - need to peruse the code to check how
PERST# is handled and whether the delay is per host controller driver.

There are two different things to agree on this patch 1) how GPIO drives
PERST# 2) the PERST# de-assertion delay.

I appreciate they are related and that Luca had to handle them together
but logically they are separated "issues", it'd be great if we manage
to nail down how they should be handled before we merge this code.
