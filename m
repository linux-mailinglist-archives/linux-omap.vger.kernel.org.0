As much as I would land on the side of same file for both, the answer to this question
is simple: the maintainer makes the decision :) So I'll respin with separate binding files.

The hidden unaddressed issue here is that by making these bindings separate it implies
they are not on equal footing (i.e. pre-series6 GPUs are not true "powervr" and so do not
belong in img,powervr.yaml). So if no one objects I'd also like to do the rename of that
file as suggested before and have:

img,powervr-sgx.yaml
img,powervr-rogue.yaml

While we could live with this, the "compatible" groupings makes life just a bit
easier. This is true really for any DT compatible string and is not based on
any technical reasoning.
