Hi Mani,

Currently Synopsys and Cadence provide SPI interrupts for reporting AERs 
etc... This IP vendor only provides an alternative approach that 
actually requires SOC design companies to design according to PCIe SPEC 
and conform to linux OS software behavior.

I have a way to workaround AER is SPI interrupt. It can also use aer.c 
drivers. However, I have been afraid to submit patch, because this is a 
problem of SOC designers themselves, which does not conform to the port 
driver of linux os (aer.c). So it will certainly not be accepted.

I agree with you.

Anyway, I would still like to request that the Cadence PCIe controller 
driver not be in module mode. Cadence also has a lot of customers, we 
are one of them, it's just that many customers don't have upstream. We 
are about to upstream.

This series was introduced since having the drivers built-in was pushed 
back at:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20250122145822.4ewsmkk6ztbeejzf@slashing/

Hans:
The Cadence PCIe root port driver can not be made into module mode 
because of TI's idea. We should consider the ideas of other customers. 
If you have to make it module mode, I think all peripheral drivers 
should be module mode. Maybe I'm being direct, but that's probably the case.

Many thanks Mani for replying to me.

Best regards,
Hans
