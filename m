I think this is just hacking around the problem. The problem is that 
omapdrm is being used by some as a generic buffer allocator. Those users 
should be changed to use a their own allocator or a generic allocator. 
And we could then drop the OMAP_BO_SCANOUT flag, as all buffers would be 
scanout buffers.

Or do we have a regression in the driver? My understanding is that this 
has never really worked.
