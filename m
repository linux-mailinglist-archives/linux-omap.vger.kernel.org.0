If you don't say what the pinctrl-single driver does with the values,
how would anyone know how to use it?

I still don't see what the goal is here.  Support generic pinconf?

Also note that while AM33XX_PADCONF() is changed, there is an in tree
board that doesn't use it, so it's broken now.  I found this change
when it broke my out of tree board, due to the dtsi change not being
reflected in my board's pinctrl values.
