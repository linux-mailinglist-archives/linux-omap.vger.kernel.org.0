I just posted these two patches with you in Cc:

ARM: OMAP2+: Drop legacy platform data for am4 qspi
ARM: dts: Configure interconnect target module for am4 qspi

I'll be adding these two into omap-for-v5.6/dt in few days
if no comments. It seems the driver changes can be sent
separately from the dts changes.

OK sounds good to me.

Oh OK, makes sense now. So wrong clock rate, thanks for explaining.
