Exactly. You need to pass OMAP_BO_SCANOUT only when you want your 
buffers to be 'scanout' buffers(i.e. buffers that can be displayed on 
screen), which is not always the case - there is no need offscreen 
buffers or pixmaps to be scanout capable, for example. There are more 
cases like that.

The problem is that scanout buffer on OMAP4 allocate additional 
resources in DMM/TILER (a piece of hardware) and those resources are 
limited. Not only that, but DMM/TILER memory space eventually gets 
fragmented over time (if you have lots of allocataoins/deallocations) 
and you will start getting ENOMEM (or similar) errors.

Ofc, in your particular use case you may never hit such issues.

I would bet on gralloc.am57x.so.

sure, the point is that with this change *every* BO will be allocated as 
scanout BO, potentially leading to the above explained issues.

Sorry, but it is like if you ask me to provide you with a tutorial on 
how to do brain surgery :)

I investigated this a bit and it seems it calls omap_bo_new() in a 
wrapper function like:

bo = omap_bo_new(dev, -page_size & (size + page_size - 1), ((param5 & 
0x800000) != 0) | OMAP_BO_WC | OMAP_BO_MEM_CONTIG);

Didn't investigate further what param5 is, but it controls if 
OMAP_BO_SCANOUT is passed to omap_bo_new or not.

However, this library was not made with upstream kernel in mind, as 
AFAIK OMAP_BO_MEM_CONTIG never made it upstream:

https://yhbt.net/lore/all/2580272.MiZDHyRxZo@avalon/T/

@Tomi - any comment?

So, you have couple of options:

1. Ask TI for upstream-compatible library.
2. Try to push OMAP_BO_MEM_CONTIG patch upstream.
3. Modify omap_bo_new() to something like:

.
.
.
#define OMAP_BO_MEM_CONTIG	0x00000008	/* only use contiguous dma mem */
.
.
.
if (flags & OMAP_BO_MEM_CONTIG)
   flags |= OMAP_BO_SCANOUT;
.
.
.

This will not achieve exactly what OMAP_BO_MEM_CONTIG is supposed to do, 
but should make it work, at least.

Ivo
