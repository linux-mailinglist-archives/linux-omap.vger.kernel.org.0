In that case, the driver should not call pm_runtime_get_sync() in its probe.
What it should do is:

	pm_runtime_set_active()
	pm_runtime_enable()

But the driver is supporting several SoC variants. Does the bootloader enable
PCIe controller for all of them?

No using dev_pm_domain_detach() is a wrong approach.

Using pm_runtime_put_sync() is the correct way, but the comment and patch
description needs to be improved. In the comment, you are claiming that
pm_runtime_put_sync() will power off the controller, even though it is true, it
is not clear who is responsible for doing that. So reword it to reflect the fact
that the power domain (genpd?) will turn off the controller.
