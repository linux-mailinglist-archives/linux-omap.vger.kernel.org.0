Maybe try adding some trace_printk() to the code.

I'd check the fifo read/write for PIO, those should end up using
ldmia/stdmia via the related read and write functions.

And maybe threaded IRQ related changes have caused longer latencies
for PIO transfers? Maybe check DMA related transfers and see if they
too are slower now?
