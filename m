+Cc Arnd and Olof,

Ansuel,
Thanks for you patch. Please cc the SoC maintainers in such submissions.
It seems that you got some quite nice discussion, but still the core
folks are not Cced, so no one would be able to take your patch...

I am pretty sure we were discussing such split idea in the past and it
did not get traction, but I cannot recall the exact discussion.

To me the idea is good but will cause huge `git am` conflicts.
Cherry-picks, backports and merges should nicely detect path renames,
but git am (and b4 am) I think cannot.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
