The hierachy above is correct. Looks like I pasted the wrong device above,
I meant dw-apb-uart.4, sorry about the extra confusion added. Eventually
the serdev device could be a child of dw-apb-uart.4:0.0 at some point as
it's specific to a serial port instance, but for now that should not be
needed.

If serial0-0 is runtime PM active, then dw-apb-uart.4 is runtime PM active
also unless ingore_children is set.

Hmm yes so maybe the issue is not with surface_serial_hub, but with serial
port device being nable to resume after __device_suspend_late() has
disabled runtime PM like you've been saying.

If the issue is with the serial port not being able to runtime resume, then
the patch below should help. Care to give it a try?

Tony
