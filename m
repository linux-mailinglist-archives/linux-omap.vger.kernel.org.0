I checked internally and IEP hardware / driver is same across all TI K3 SoCs.
Compatible "ti,am654-icss-iep" will be same for all SoCs. I don't think we need
to introduce different compatibles for different SoCs in future as they will be
using same hardware / driver. For now I will have below as compatible in dt
bindings. This will not change in future. When new SoCs are added, they can
just use this compatible itself. The driver will always use "ti,am654-icss-iep"
as compatible.

	- ti,am654-icss-iep   # for all TI K3 SoCs
