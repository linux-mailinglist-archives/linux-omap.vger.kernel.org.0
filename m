The aim was to allow userspace to see accurate values for charge_now,
charge_full and capacity (percentage) of the battery. It will allow
the user to estimate how long the device can work on the battery
with current power consumption.

For this the user will need to do a battery calibration. I.e.
he will need to fully charge and then discharge the battery.
Or vice versa: discharge -> charge. Once the user completes the
calibration cycle, he will be able to see pretty accurate values
for charge_now, charge_full and capacity. This is similar to how
bq27200 IC from Nokia N900 works.

Also this patchset allows the userspace to restore the calibration
value after reboot. By the calibration value I mean charge_full.

We can't rely on restoring charge_now value, because the user may
have multiple operating systems installed and if he works in another
OS for a while the charge_now value will become invalid.

So, after a reboot the user may want to restore the charge_full
value, so the kernel will be able to estimate the percentage
and capacity values without forcing the user to do a full calib-
ration cycle again. The only thing the user will have to do
is to fully charge OR fully discharge the battery at least once.
And he will get all values set.

Now about the chosen limits. For some reason the charging is
interrupted (and restarted after a while) when the following
conditions are met:
1) the charging current is < 112 mA
2) the display backlight is off

This behaviour was observed in Maemo Leste with hildon-desktop
running. I tested these patches for several days, so I picked up
the parameters for optimal (from my point of view) work in practice
taking into account the current "features" of Droid 4 drivers.

If we could somehow fix this behaviour (charging interruption),
I'd reconsider the end of charge current value to be 50 mA.

Making it lower than 50 mA doesn't seem to make much sence
because of the extended charging time visibility without giving
significant improvement in charge_full accuracy.

No worries. With the implemented algorithm, the user will not notice
that the battery is more than 100% charged (which is just a convention
here). And this situation gives an advantage in that it has a slightly
pessimistic charge_full value, which in practice turns out to be good:
the user will be warned about low battery a little ahead of time.
