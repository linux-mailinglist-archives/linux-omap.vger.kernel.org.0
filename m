Do you mean that I set 1 << 29 and 30 as sort of macros in the
k3-pinctrl.h file and then include it in pinctrl-single.c?

Are we okay to #include a header from arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti?

If I understand what Nishanth is saying correctly, are we expected to
set the wake_en bit on every single K3 SoC's every single padconf reg?

I am a little sceptical with this approach, because what is people
_don't_ want to wakeup from certain pads? What would be the right way to
disable wakeup on those pads then?

Any voltage level shift can potentially trigger a daisychain and I don't
think that's really such a good idea?

In my limited experience, I have only seen daisychain wakeups being
enabled on AM62x SOC. This is because this is one of the first K3
devices to implement deepsleep, and I think IO daisychain only applies for
wakeups in the case of deepsleep kind of scenarios.

Sure, I could take a look, but setting wake_en on all pads still
doesn't feel right to me.

To summarise, I don't think any other devices are using daisychain
atleast today, and even if there is possibility of using in future I
think the same compatible I have used here can be used to set wake_en
wherever applicable, for eg. whenever AM62A would want to use daisychain
it can use this quirk in it's DT node.

I believe that we shouldn't set every pad as daisychain enabled
otherwise in deepsleep it may result in unintended wakeups. And the way
I thought we can give this choice to the user is using wakeirq chained
interrupt along with this quirk,
compatible = "ti,am6-padconf";
