The "mem" region in never ioremapped. However $patch removes requiring to add
"mem" memory resource.

You mean we don't need to add "new *ops* for CPU addr fixup"?. The issue is
ranges provides CPU address and PCI address. The CPU will access whatever is
populated in ranges to access the PCI bus. However while programming the ATU,
we cannot use the CPU address provided in ranges directly (in some platforms)
because the controller does not see the full address and only the lower 28bits.

This similar restriction was there with Designware (mostly an integration
issue) and we used *ops* to fixup the address that has to be programmed in ATU.
The Designware initially used a wrapper so that ranges property can be directly
used [1]. However this approach was later removed in [2]
