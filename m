I had to use the pm-opp version, since almost everyone was using that.

On the other hand, there isn't a lot of OPP specific stuff in
dev_pm_opp_of_register_em(). It just uses dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count(),
that's all. This ended up in the OPP core, nothing else. Maybe we can
now move it back to the EM core and name it differently ?

Sadly yes :(

I think that design needs to be looked over again, it looks broken to
me everytime I land onto this code. I wonder why we don't unregister
stuff.

Lets say, I am working on the cpufreq driver and I want to test that
on my ARM machine. Rebooting a simpler board to test stuff out is
easy, but if I am working on an ARM server which is running lots of
other userspace stuff as well, I won't want to reboot the machine just
to test a different versions of the driver. I will rather want to
build the driver as module and insert/remove it again and again.

If the frequency table changes in between versions, this just breaks
as EM won't be updated again.

This breaks one of the most basic rules of Linux Kernel. Inserting a
module should have exactly the same final behavior every single time.
This model doesn't guarantee it. It simply looks broken.

Yes, we need to take care of all such special cases as well.
