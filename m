Thanks for the feedback! You would say yes, you can merge patch 2,
except it probably does not even apply as it is written in a way that is
based on the changes in patch 1.

I could rewrite patch 2 to not depend on patch 1 of course, but it
wouldn't make code simpler, perhaps more complex. And moreover the
hardware that I used to have access to has phy_count==1 so I could never
test the failing case, and sadly now I have no access to that hardware.
