Yes that would be nice to do eventually :)

Good point.

Yes agreed, runtime PM may disable the clock and shut down the UART so
should be done after uart_change_pm().

BTW, Andy has follow-up patches to also drop the old uart_pm in favor of
runtime PM :)

As this is kernel console related we may be able to just leave out the
runtime PM calls here, see the two commits below. Andy, do you have some
comments?

See the following two commits for kernel console handling:

bedb404e91bb ("serial: 8250_port: Don't use power management for kernel console")
a3cb39d258ef ("serial: core: Allow detach and attach serial device for console")

Thanks for looking through the patches again, I'll take a look at all
your comments and will repost after the merge window.

Regards,

Tony
