Hmm so we could add a list of all the registered struct uart_port or
uart_state to struct serial_controller. Then looking up struct device would
be just looking at the first list entry. We need to take port_mutex, but
that should be mostly when the device does runtime PM. We'll be needing that
list anyways later on to flush pending TX on runtime PM resume for each
port associated with the device.

OK makes sense. And thanks for reviewing again :)
