well, it depends on the wlan dts patch. I think we are better of with having
both applied now. It is a better description of the hardware, and that is what
the devicetree is about. Having wlan randomly working without undocumented
description is IMHO worse than with a clear description.
The reason why this did not come to light earlier is because I had tested it on top
of a bunch of regression fixes for the twl (which were accepted at that point) 
and I did miss the fact that I had also a had a local hack amoung them to enable
the clock by a simple register write in _probe it twl-core.c.

I think as Stephen has little comments about the last version and just not
collected anything else than fixes for -rc, I would think it simply will be
applied. I think he just has a late start.

Regards,
Andreas
