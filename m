There's already a generic pinconf feature for pinctrl-single.  It
seems like this could be used with am335x now without any changes,
e.g. by adding "pinctrl-single,drive-strength" to define the bits that
control drive strength.  It doesn't require added cells to use this.
Pin mux and configuration fields all have masks defined.

Example, add this:
#define PULL_MASK (PULL_UP|PULL_DISABLE)
pinctrl-single,bias-pullup = <PULL_DISABLE PULL_UP PULL_DISABLE PULL_MASK>;
pinctrl-single,bias-pulldown = <PULL_DISABLE 0 PULL_DISABLE PULL_MASK>;

If I read the driver right (the bindings doc is far from clear), then
I think that configures the pin with pad pull up/down disabled and
allows the generic pinconf system to enable the pullup or pulldown.
Combining the definition of the fields with the value to initialize it
in the same property doesn't make that much sense to me.

pinctrl-cells is really pretty different from gpio-cells and
interrupt-cells.  The latter two are used in handles that allow an
external node to reference something in the node that defines the gpio
or interrupt cells.  The generic flags are used by an *unrelated
driver* to tell an platform specific interrupt controller driver it
should configure an edge triggered interrupt.  It makes it easier to
use the binding in the unrelated driver that needs an interrupt since
the flags are always the same.  But mainly it works because the gpio
and interrupt framework in the kernel already support these concepts,
so the flags can get passed as is to existing kernel functions.

But pinctrl-single,pins is only used inside pinctrl-single itself.
There's no handle anywhere like:
yoyodyne,reset = <&am335x_pinmux AM335X_PIN_FOO MUX_MODE7
GENERIC_PULLUP_ENABLED_FLAG>;
I don't see how one could get made either, since there's already a
pinctrl system and it just doesn't work that way.

The closest thing would be the generic pin config type bindings, which
go in the pinctrl driver's nodes, and look like this:
&am335x_pinmux {
    pinctrl_yoyo_reset: yoyogrp {
        pins = "foo";
        function = "gpio";
        bias-pull-up;
    };
};

That would work on some other boards.  To use pinctrl-single, you'd
need to have a binding that mapped pin and function names to numbers
(why couldn't the pincfg binding use numbers!) and the bits/mask for
pull up.  Which could be done.  But at that point pinctrl-single,pins
is replaced, it wouldn't even get used, so adding more cells to it
hasn't done anything for you.

Is "some additional property for specifying generic conf flags"
different from the existing pinctrl-single,bias-pullup, etc.
properties?  Because splitting the data cell into two parts doesn't
make any difference to those.
