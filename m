Thanks again for listing this here but please get our point, that this
seems like just another 'mode' for the matrix keypad driver which can be
selected by the system integrator.

Once it lands in mainline, it can be used by everyone.

I would really appreciate if you could integrate your work into matrix
keypad driver.
