Hello Bjorn, it should be expected that other changes for PCIe drivers
sent by other people which were sent to the list before this patch
series and are still waiting for the review (because are without
comments), would be processed before and patches sent later.

Also I would like to point out that in past I have sent fixes for PCIe
mvebu driver, which is currently in the broken state. And this is also
on waiting on the list.
