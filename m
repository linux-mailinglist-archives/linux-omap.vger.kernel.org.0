Well the consumer device could call pm_runtime_get_sync(dmadev)
when the USB cable is connected for example, and then call
pm_runtime_pu(dmadev) when let's say the USB cable is disconnected.

Without using pm_runtime_irq_safe() we currently don't have a
clear path for doing this where the pm_runtime_get_sync(dmadev)
may sleep.

Oh I see. Yes the consumer driver would need to check for
the completed dma transfer in all cases. The delay issues
should not currently happen in the musb_ep_program() problem
case as it gets called from IRQ context.

And no, adding pm_runtime_get_sync() to issue_pending is not
a solution. There may be clocks and regulators that need to
be powered up, and we don't want to use pm_runtime_irq_safe()
because of the permanent use count on the parent.

Tony
