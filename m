My interest is came out of my desire to turn on generic pinconf for AM3358
and I had to fix a bug that was breaking compatible "pinconf,single":
f46fe79ff1b6 ("pinctrl-single: fix pcs_parse_pinconf() return value")

Thanks, that is a good point that arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-guardian.dts
needs to be converted from AM33XX_IOPAD to AM33XX_PADCONF.  I'll submit
a patch for that.

Regarding AM33XX_PADCONF() restructuring, the change to have seperate
arguments for direction and mux in AM33XX_PADCONF() predates my
invovlement, so I've CC'd Christina Quast.

    commit f1ff9be7652b716c7eea67c9ca795027d911f148
    Author: Christina Quast <cquast@hanoverdisplays.com>
    Date:   Mon Apr 8 10:01:51 2019 -0700

    ARM: dts: am33xx: Added AM33XX_PADCONF macro
    
    AM33XX_PADCONF takes three instead of two parameters, to make
    future changes to #pinctrl-cells easier.
    
    For old boards which are not mainlined, we left the AM33XX_IOPAD
    macro.

Hopefully, Tony can also chime in.
