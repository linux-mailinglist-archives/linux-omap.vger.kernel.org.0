Thanks!  Obviously you should make the Root Port advertise
PCI_EXP_DEVCAP2_ARI if you want to use that functionality.

But I think the fact that we add a device with fn > 7 when ARI is not
enabled is also an underlying defect in iov.c.  

sriov_init() already checks whether ARI is enabled, and I think we
should probably remember that somewhere and use it in
pci_iov_add_virtfn() to avoid adding VFs with fn > 7.
