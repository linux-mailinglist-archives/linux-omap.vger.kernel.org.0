I have confimed here that logicpd torpedo devkit with battery
works just fine while entering off mode during idle. I can see
the temperature just fine with:

# cat /sys/class/power_supply/bq27000-battery/uevent
POWER_SUPPLY_NAME=bq27000-battery
POWER_SUPPLY_STATUS=Charging
POWER_SUPPLY_PRESENT=1
POWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_NOW=3829000
POWER_SUPPLY_CURRENT_NOW=-592084
POWER_SUPPLY_CAPACITY_LEVEL=Normal
POWER_SUPPLY_TEMP=306
POWER_SUPPLY_TECHNOLOGY=Li-ion
POWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_FULL_DESIGN=2056320
POWER_SUPPLY_CYCLE_COUNT=0
POWER_SUPPLY_POWER_AVG=0
POWER_SUPPLY_MANUFACTURER=Texas Instruments

This is 37xx though, maybe you have 35xx and there's some errata
that we're not handling?

I'm only seeing "2.7. HDQTM/1-WireÂ® Communication Constraints"
for external pull-up resitor in 34xx errata at [0].

I wonder if wrong external pull could cause flakyeness after
enabling the hdq module?

If nothing else helps, you could try to block idle for hdq
module, but I have a feeling that's a workaround for something
else.

Regards,

Tony
