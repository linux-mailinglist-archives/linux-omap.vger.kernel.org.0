Ah, ok now I see.

You want to make the "ti,omap3630" the official one and "ti,omap36xx" =
legacy.
It is probably an arbitrary choice if we want to get rid of the xx or =
the 30.

I had thought to do it the other way round because I had done this =
statistics:

for i in 3430 34xx 3630 36xx; do echo $i $(fgrep '"'ti,omap$i'"' =
arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dts* | wc -l); done

3430 12
34xx 28
3630 3
36xx 23

which would indicate that 34xx and 36xx are more common.

Yes, it already does everywhere.

BTW there is also some code that does special SoC detection based on
soc_device_match(), mainly in omapdrm/dss.

If we were to use this mechanism in the ti-cpufreq driver we could
match it to ti,omap3 and could avoid all these changes.

But make it less maintainable and code more complex.

Ok. I'll rework the patch so that we never add "ti,34xx" or "ti,36xx"
but add "ti,3430" or "ti,3630" if missing.

I'll also take a look at omap.txt bindings since that likely needs
an update as well to better describe what the official ones are
and which are legacy.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
