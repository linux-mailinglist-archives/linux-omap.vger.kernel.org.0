No issue on my side.

By the way, during initial investigations, I've traced code paths to
figure out if there was a particular step that would consume a large
amount of time, and found out that of_platform_populate() ends up
executing devlink-related code that seems to have an O(n^3) complexity
on the number of devices, with a few dozens of milliseconds for each
iteration. That's a very bad complexity.
