Everything here has different revisions because any device that uses
the same revision can also use the same base compatible string. For
instance AM335x SoCs use the SGX530 revision 125, same as OMAP3630,
so I simply reuse that compatible in their DT as you can see in
patch [5/10]. I didn't see the need for a new compatible string
for identical (i.e. "compatible") IP and integration.

The first device to use that IP/revision combo gets the named
compatible, all others re-use the same compatible where possible.
