That is why I propose to make the clocks optional. This solves both
cases in a simple and neat way.

Yes. But why "currently"? Do you think the OMAPs we already have
defined and tested will change?

Yes, that is what I want to propose for v7:

  clocks:
    maxItems: 1

  clock-names:
    maxItems: 1
    items:
      - const: gpu

Ah, now I understand your motivation: you have access and experience =
with
the A31 and you know that our proposal doesn't fit to it.

=46rom what I know from your description is that the A31 is quite =
special with
4 GPU clocks... Are they all really for the GPU or 3 of them for the =
interface
logic (like on OMAP which separates between "functional clocks" and =
"interface
clocks")? Or are there 4 groups of GPU cores with a separate clock for =
each one?

So what would be your proposal for the A31 DT?

Then I get a chance to compare DT snippets and try to make a mixture for
the bindings.

That is IMHO common practise everywhere. Sometimes you even have to =
adapt
years old DT to new limitations of the drivers (this happened recently =
for
combination of SPI and GPIO).=20

And you can still write two different drivers for a single bindings =
document
or use the .data field of the compatibility table. And I think clocks =
and regulators
can also be referenced by name if they are not defined in DT. This is =
not a
"single variety" style, but a potential solution.

What I want to say: there are many roads to Rome.

Philipp has something minimal working on the A83 which works with the =
proposed
binding and enabled him to read out the sgx revision register.

So if you are a specialist for the A31 SGX, please make a proposal for a =
binding
that covers all the A31 needs and all other SoC we know. Or define a =
separate
bindings for the A31.

Thank you very much,
