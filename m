Well, it is a not very well documented property of the GPU. We have no =
data sheet of the standalone GPU. Only several SoC data sheets which =
give some indications.

It appears as if some sgx5xx versions have 3 clocks and some have 4. So =
you are right, the number of clocks depends on the sgx5xx version and =
that could be made dependent in the bindings (if necessary).

>=20

either 0, or 4, depending on whether or not you have a wrapper.

I think this is contradicting your previous sentence. If the number of =
clocks is a property of the GPU and not the integration it must also not =
depend on whether there is a wrapper. I.e. it must be a constant for any =
type of integration.

The really correct variant would be to always make the SoC integration =
(wrapper) a separate subsystem (because it is never part of the SGX core =
but some interface bus) and clock provider and connect it explicitly to =
the clock inputs.

To be clear: I am not at all against describing the clocks. I just doubt =
that the time we invest into discussing on this level of detail and =
adding conditional clock requirements is worth the result. IMHO the =
bindings and .dts do not become better by describing them in more detail =
than just "optional". It just takes our time from contributing to other =
subsystems.

change! Because they are tested and working and the bindings.yaml has =
been adapted to the result. So we have just duplicated something for no =
practical benefit.

developers not only have to figure out which clocks they need in the DTS =
but they also have to add a patch to the implementation specific part of =
the bindings.yaml to clearly define exactly the same what they already =
have written into their .dts (the clocks are either there for the =
of_node or they are not). So again the rules are for no benefit, since a =
new SoC is introduced exactly once. And tested if it works. And if it is =
there, it will stay as it is. It is just work for maintainers to review =
that patch as well.
>=20

moot.

Agreed, I forgot this aspect. Nevertheless, it is easier to review a new =
compatible string than a new clock number rule (question: how do you =
practically review this? By looking if it does match the DTS?).

We have to add the compatible string as long as we need to have the SoC =
name in the compatible string (which as said is my dream to get rid of =
in far future). If we could get rid of it, there won't be a change any =
more. By just taking "img,sgx544" into a new SoC. The change would be =
moved into SoC specific wrappers. In such an ideal world, we would =
explicitly describe the wrappers as separate DT nodes. Even if they have =
no explicit driver (e.g. by some simple-pm-bus).

                   PRCM,bus,
Processor <<---->> Wrapper <<----->> SGX
ti,...             ti,sysc           img,sgx530
img,...            simple-bus        img,sgx540
samsung,...        ...               img,sgx544
other,             other,gpu-wrapper img,...

But this IMHO correct proposal was already rejected.

So at the moment we are circling around several proposals because none =
can fulfill all requirements.

Therefore my attempt to solve the gordian knot is to make clocks =
generally optional. This keeps the bindings simple but not generally =
wrong. And since the DTS are not only tested against bindings.yaml but =
on real hardware, the omission to enforce a specific number of clocks =
doesn't harm anyone. As said it is impossible to get the SGX running =
without defining the correct clocks (whether they are enforced by =
bindings.yaml or not).

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
