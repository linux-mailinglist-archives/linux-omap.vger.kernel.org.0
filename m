set_tdm_slots() is for setting how the TDM slots supposed to be used by
the component and not really for things to configure different operating
modes.

If you hardwire things in set_tdm_slots() for the droid4 then how the
codec driver can be reused in other setups?

Neither component should call set_sysclk, set_tdm_slots. The machine
driver should as it is the only one who know how things are wired...
