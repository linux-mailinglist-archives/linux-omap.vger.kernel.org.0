I pulled up a couple of DRA7xx TRMs out of curiosity - thanks for having such easy-to-access documentation by the way :) - and they both give me a clear impression that the entire L3_MAIN interconnect is limited to 32-bit addresses and thus pretty much all the DMA masters should only be able to touch the lower 2GB of DRAM. Especially the bit that explicitly says "This is a high address range (Q8 â€“ Q15) that requires an address greater than 32 bits. This space is visible only for the MPU Subsystem."

OK makes sense to me.

OK
