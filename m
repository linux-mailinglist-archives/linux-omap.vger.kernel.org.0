No, not really. As far as I'm concerned, the only unequal footing here
is that one driver is in-tree and the other isn't, but this situation
was handled nicely for Mali GPUs and lima that used to be in the same
situation for example.

The situation is simple, really: bindings are supposed to be backward
compatible, period. If we ever make a change to that binding that isn't,
you will be well within your right to complain because your driver is
now broken.

Sounds good to me.
