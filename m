There is no code change. The same compatible is used for other SoCs. Even if
the code is same I was thinking to keep the compatible as below now

- ti,am654-icss-iep   # for K3 AM65x SoCs

and once other SoCs are introduced, I will just modify the comment,

- ti,am654-icss-iep   # for K3 AM65x, AM64x SoCs

But we can also keep the all SoCs in comment right from start as well. I am
fine with both.

Conor / Roger, Please let me know which approach should I go with in next revision?
