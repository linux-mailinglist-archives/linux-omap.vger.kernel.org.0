I think the timer hardware is the same across am64, am65 and j7. So we
should pick something to represent the am6 timers as it would allow using
shared dtsi files for the 16 - 30 timers there are.

Using shared timer dtsi files should work as long as the clocks are
defined in include/dt-bindings/clock for each SoC, and assuming we can use
the same compatible property for the timers.

Of course if the timers are really different across am64, am65 and j72
then multiple compatible properties are neeeded.

If the timer hardware is the same, then I guess we should just pick the
earliest version, so how about using ti,am64-timer?

Regards,

Tony
