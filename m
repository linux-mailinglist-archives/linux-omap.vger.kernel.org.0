But you don't need a lock everywhere. You need locks in the callers
(and only sometimes).

Now I'm wondering how set_msi is not racy in the current code with the
host setting/clearing PCI_MSI_FLAGS_ENABLE? Maybe that bit is RO from
the EP side?

Ultimately I think you're going to have to provide your own endpoint
functions or you need accessors for specific registers like
PCI_MSI_FLAGS. Then for example, you just rely on the 2 bytes before
PCI_MSI_FLAGS being reserved and do a 32-bit access without a RMW.
Trying to abstract this at the register read/write level is going to
be fragile.
