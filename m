Hei hei,

for leds-gpio you can use the properties 'function' and 'color' in the
devicetree node and omit 'label', the label is constructed
automatically.  This is a common feature supposed to be working for all
LED drivers.  However it did not yet work for the 'leds-pwm' driver.

This series removes platform_data support for the leds-pwm driver and
takes the opportunity to update the leds-pwm dt-bindings accordingly.

After myself being one week on vacation patch 2/3 was already picked by
Pavel and I gathered some more feedback on the remaining issues.

v6 was compile tested and dt_bindings_check and dtbs_check were run.

Note: I added some patches to fix DT schema warnings, but I did not put
every reviewer/supporter/maintainer printed by get_maintainers in Cc to
keep that list reasonable small.

Series changelog below …

Alex

v6:
- rebased series on recent pavel/for-next
- added Reviewed-by from Marek to patch 1
- patch 2 from v5 was picked by Pavel and is already in his for-next
  branch
- previous patch 3/3 (now 2/7) was reworked based on feedback by Rob
- added more dt patches fixing warnings after binding conversion to yaml

v5:
- replaced patch 1/3 by a new patch removing platform_data support for
  the leds-pwm driver
- little rewording of commit message in patch 2/3
- updated patch 3/3 based on feedback by Rob Herring
- added Marek Behún to Cc, because he also works on removing
  platform_data support
- rebased series on pavel/for-next

v4:
- added led-class patch handling fwnode passing differently (patch 1/3)
- adapted leds-pwm patch to new led-class (patch 2/3)
- contacted original author of leds-pwm dt binding on license issue
  (patch 3/3)

v3:
- series rebased on v5.9-rc4
- changed license of .yaml file to recommended one (patch 2/2)
- added Acked-by to both patches

v2:
- series rebased on v5.9-rc3
- added the dt-bindings update patch (2/2)

v1:
- based on v5.9-rc2
- backport on v5.4.59 tested and working
