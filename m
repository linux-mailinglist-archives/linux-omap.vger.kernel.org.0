Hi all,

Just to follow-up on the information below.

So I've compared measurements from my power supply to measurements from
Baylibre ACME ina226, custom ina226 setup and ARM Energy Probe, and turns
out it's my power supply that has started wrong values and propably needs
calibration :)

So apologies for bashing the cpcap coulomb counter, it seems it's already
quite accurate showing average few mW less over 3 minute sample period
compared to my other measurements.

Regards,

Tony
