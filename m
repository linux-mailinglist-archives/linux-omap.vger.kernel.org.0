Hmm well we do have two chargers, the usb charger and the
unknown inductive charger for the pins on the back.

It would be best to keep cpcap-battery.c independent of the
chargers to avoid depndencies as the chargers do usually start
charging briefly always when connected.

Maybe just adding something like below would be enough of a check:

static int
cpcap_battery_get_counter_rate(struct cpcap_battery_ddata *ddata,
			       int poll_time_ms);

And then based on the value being negative or positive you
would know if it's charging or not. I guess we could then
use this also for POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CHARGE_NOW with poll_time_ms
value of 0. I think the charge counter is configure to poll
at 250 ms right now.

Regards,

Tony
