Yes, you were right...

To my surprise, this did report an mmc6 host port where the OMAP5 only =
has 4...

Yes, we have a special driver for the txs02612 sdio switch and voltage =
translator
chip to make two ports out of the single mmc2 port of the OMAP5 SoC.

This driver was begun ca. 7 years ago but never finished...

The idea is to make a mmc port have several subports. For the Pyra =
handheld hardware
we needed 5 mmc/sdio interfaces but the omap5 only has 4 of them =
available to us.

So the txs02612 drivers is sitting between the omap5 mmc2 host pins and =
switches
between an =C2=B5SD slot and an eMMC.

Therefore, the driver is a mmc client driver (like e.g. the driver of =
some WiFi chip
connected to some SDIO port) and provides multiple mmc host interfaces.

It should intercept data transfer requests to its multiple mmc hosts, =
synchronize
(or enqueue) them, control the switch gpio and forward requests to the =
processor's
mmc host port so that they are processed (after switching).

We never continued to make this work...

What remained is simple code to manually throw the switch through some =
/sysfs
control file after doing an eject and before a fresh partprobe.

Still, the probe function of the txs02612 driver does two calls to =
mmc_add_host().
These seem to make=20

>=20

get stuck. Most likely because the initialization is not complete for =
handling
card detection.

When not calling mmc_add_host() in our txs02612 driver fragment we can
properly shut down the OMAP5. That is the solution with the least =
efforts.
The other would be to make the txs02612 properly work...

So in summary there is no bug upstream. It is in our tree.

If you are interested in how our code fragment for the txs02612 looks =
like:

s/letux/txs02612

Maybe you have some suggestions to make it work?
