Sorry I mean .shutdown function. But I doubt this is a modem
issue you're seeing, I already fixed that issue most likely with
commit 8ead7e817224 ("usb: core: Add PM runtime calls to
usb_hcd_platform_shutdown"). Well at least things are shutting
down for me now after checking few times. I recall the symptoms
of the shut down failing issue is that the also the LCD backlight
stays on.

There are some issues left with musb configured as a usb
gadget, but I have not been able to quite track those down
so far. It seems that there are some gadget framework kobject
warnings with the musb controlling device (omap2430) unloaded
and then doing a shutdown. The device shuts down though.

AFAIK this issue still remains. I'll take a look at adding a
.shutdown somewhere for cpcap driver(s) so we get it cleared
for a low-power state.
