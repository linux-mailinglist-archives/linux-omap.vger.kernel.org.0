The ASoC core creates dummy codec and dummy dai. They can be used by
machine drivers when there is a need for a dummy connection.

If it expects separate DAI in place where you don't actually have a DAI
then it should use the dummy dai.

Yes, that's the one. _dx is the tx pin from McBSP pow.

The cpcap driver should no nothing about mdm6600 or anything which is
outside of it, similarly to mdm6600.
The machine driver knows that in the driod4 you have McBSP2, McBSP3,
CPCAP, MDM6600 and WL1285. It is the role of the machine driver to make
these work together.

Not really, we have dummy dai/codec from core, the machine driver should
use them.

Just think about: what if you move the audio setup to a new board with
am5 for example? You will have McASP in place of McBSP, so you will also
patch it up to create dummy mcasp dais?
What if you move the setup to Tegra or imx, or qc? Patch everything up
to create dummy dais?

In a graph the port is the DAI. We have only one port in McBSP and it is
bi-directional (dr/dx pins + clk lines).

Usually you have one McBSP connected to one codec, graph is clean: port
to port.

In droid4 the physical lines are connecting together the 4 ports:
McBSP3, CPCAP_voice, MDM6600 and Wl1285, right?
It is a web ;)

But you still have _one_ port on the McBSP3 and not three. I guess the
endpoints are coming into picture at this point to represent that the
port is connected to multiple ports.
The endpoints should control the port which is their parent.

mcbsp3_port {
	reg = <0>;
	mcbsp3_ep0: endpoint0 { remote-endpoint = <&cpcap_voice_ep0>; };
	mcbsp3_ep1: endpoint1 { remote-endpoint = <&dmd6600_ep0>; };
	mcbsp3_ep2: endpoint2 { remote-endpoint = <&wl1285_ep0>; };
};

cpcap_voice_port {
	reg = <0>;
	cpcap_voice_ep0: endpoint0 { remote-endpoint = <&mcbsp3_ep0>; };
	cpcap_voice_ep1: endpoint1 { remote-endpoint = <&dmd6600_ep1>;};
	cpcap_voice_ep2: endpoint2 { remote-endpoint = <&wl1285_ep1>; };
};

Or something...

If the cpcap_voice_ep1 <-> dmd6600_ep1 link is enabled then the McBSP3
port is not, it is not part of the graph.

In any case you will need DPCM for this to work to push the needed
parameters to the codecs in case of codec2codec connection.
