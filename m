Yes, I would like to see PowerVR Series 5 SGX supported upstream since =
there
are still so many devices in the wild which could use it. The most =
advanced
being the Pyra handheld gaming computer but there are omap4 based phones
or other omap3/amm335x based devices.

And the only reason the OpenPVRSGX group was founded (BTW not by me, I =
am just
maintaining the code and running a mailing list because it was rejected =
to host
it on vger.kernel.org), was to make that happen.

=46rom the GitHub description:
	This is about shaping existing GPL Linux kernel drivers for the =
PVR/SGX5
	architecture so that they can become accepted into =
drivers/staging

But nobody can currently tell if it can be integrated with the recently =
upstreamed
Rogue driver (I wouldn't call that *the* imagination driver) or if it =
better stays
a separate driver because the first would need touching closed =
user-space code
and GPU firmware.

And nobody knows who is capable and willing to work on it. It depends on =
access to
(confidential) documentation and available time to make such a big task =
a rewarding
project. And discussions like this one are not at all encouraging to =
even try.

I have listed some "pros" for "single file" but you apparently don't see
them as such. I can't change that. The main argument is that a single =
file is
simpler than two files duplicating parts, which are apparently the same
(integration of PVR architectures into SoC doesn't differ very much: =
shared
register block, DMA memory, clocks, resets etc.).
Yours is that two files duplicating such common things is "more =
convenient".
I just wonder for whom.

But it seems as if the IMHO second best solution has already been =
chosen.
So let it be.

What I want to avoid is a situation that upstream activities do not take =
the
existing and working out-of-tree SGX driver into account and make =
porting
(not even speaking of upstreaming) that driver more difficult than =
necessary
and force device tree files to contain redundant information nobody will =
need
and use. You can of course ignore experience and suggestions of people
who have worked on an SGX driver for a while. But that is the reason why =
I
participate in this discussion and raise my voice.

Now, I am looking forward to a v2 of this patch.

BR,
Nikolaus
