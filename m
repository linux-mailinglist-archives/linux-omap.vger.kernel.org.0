In my opinion timeout is not platform specific as I wrote in email:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20210310110535.zh4pnn4vpmvzwl5q@pali/

My experiments already proved that some PCIe cards needs to be in reset
state for some minimal time otherwise they cannot be enumerated. And it
does not matter to which platform you connect those (endpoint) cards.

I do not think that timeout itself is platform specific. GPIO controls
PERST# pin and therefore specified sleep value directly drives how long
is card on the other end of PCIe slot in Warm Reset state. PCIe CEM spec
directly says that PERST# signal controls PCIe Warm Reset.

What is here platform specific thing is that PERST# signal is controlled
by GPIO. But value of signal (high / low) and how long is in signal in
which state for me sounds like not an platform specific thing, but as
PCIe / CEM related.
