Sorry for the delay, the patch looks good to me:

The keypad is in the wakeup domain and has SYSC_OMAP2_ENAWAKEUP set in
the dts, so padconf irqs should not be needed as long as the device is
clocked. As the source clock is sys_32k_ck, not sure if gating it would
save any power, so padconf interrupts are probably not needed.

Sounds like on 4430 the gate bit does not do anything while on 4460 it
does. The source clock seems to be sys_32k_ck so it's enabled anyways
and should not affect power management.

Regards,

Tony
