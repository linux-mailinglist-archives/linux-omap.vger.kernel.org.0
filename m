OK. BTW, with PocketBeagle and mainline v5.6 kernel, I see the micro-USB
connection always get disconnected after few hours of use. Are you aware
ofthat?

This is with the micro-USB configured as acm and ecm gadget via configfs.

So the gpio-ranges tells the gpio contorller what pinctrl device pin
to use for configuring things.

No I don't think so. The pinctrl-single could be additionally
configured for gpio functionality too. For omaps, that gpio
functionality would be mostly limited to output toggling using the
internal pulls. Would be still usable on some systems though.

Also, it's been a while so I don't remember where I started running
into addressing issues though.. My guess is that you will soon hit
them too and notice :)

But basically we want to reference the pinctrl pins based on their
physical offset from the padconf base register, and not based on an
invented number in the dts. Well maybe you can describe the problem
further for us to discuss when you see it :)

Regards,

Tony
