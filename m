Can you maybe try to temporarily disable the L3 driver and see if the stack
trace is more accurate on what goes wrong? Just comment out the line for
postcore_initcall_sync(omap3_l3_init) in drivers/bus/omap_l3_smx.c. The
system will hang on the invalid access rather than triggering the L3
error first.

Tony
