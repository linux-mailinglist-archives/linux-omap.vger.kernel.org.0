Actually, is it really just SATA? I pulled up a couple of DRA7xx TRMs 
out of curiosity - thanks for having such easy-to-access documentation 
by the way :) - and they both give me a clear impression that the entire 
L3_MAIN interconnect is limited to 32-bit addresses and thus pretty much 
all the DMA masters should only be able to touch the lower 2GB of DRAM. 
Especially the bit that explicitly says "This is a high address range 
(Q8 â€“ Q15) that requires an address greater than 32 bits. This space is 
visible only for the MPU Subsystem."

Is it in fact the case that the SATA driver happens to be the only one 
to set a >32-bit DMA mask on your system?
