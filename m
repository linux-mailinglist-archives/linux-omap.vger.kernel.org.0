Well the long term solution would be to make it probe with
ti-sysc interconnect target module driver, then you can specify
both fck and ick there as needed.

Care to test with the patch below (without your changes) to see if
something else is still needed?

I only added the fck there, not sure if we should also the l3 ick.
Eventually this node will be a child of the l3 interconnect, and
genpd will ensure the l3 ick is in use when pm_runtime_get() is
done in the qspi driver.

Note that this will produce a boot time warning until the related
hwmod data is dropped. I'll be posting a proper patch once we
know what's going on here, not sure what's the right fix for the
clock issue for v5.5-rc series though.

Regards,

Tony
