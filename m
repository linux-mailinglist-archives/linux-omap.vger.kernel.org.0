I used to have access to a hardware with phy_count = 1 on a former job,
but I don't have it anymore and won't have it since I left that job
position.

Honestly, I'm afraid I don't have much time to invest in trying to
recollect all the details and motivations for this patchset. Likely I
spotted this by code inspection while debugging other issues (I had a
non-working PCIe device, but it was not the host fault). If you think
there is little value in these patches, I'm OK in dropping them.
