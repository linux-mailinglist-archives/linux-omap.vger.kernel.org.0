Yeah, but they are just removals without any proper replacements where the
current drivers already are using some kind of runtime PM. I was focused and
able to test only 8250 part.

IIRC the uart_set_options() can be called during early boot stages where no
device is present and we need to handle those cases, otherwise it will be
KABOOMs. I.o.w. we3 may not get rid of those checks (at least in a simple way).

Thanks, Tony, for moving this forward and Johan for good review!
