This patch is addressing an issue wrt how DWC PCIe MSI IRQ status is
aggregated at TI wrapper level:

There is a single MSI status bit which is supposed to be logical OR of
all the MSI IRQ status bits inside the DWC wrapper.  So if any of the
MSI IRQ status bits are set then this bit should read 1 and raise an
interrupt to CPU.
IRQ handler would then go through each MSI bit (inside DWC) and call
corresponding handler and then clear individual bits.
So the expectation was that wrapper level MSI status bit would auto
clear once all the DWC level MSI bits are cleared or wrapper will keep
the interrupt line asserted if there are still some outstanding ones.

But unfortunately that does not seem to be the case, MSI status bit in
the wrapper needs to be cleared manually. And moreover, once wrapper
level bit is cleared, the observation is that all the IRQ status bit
inside the DWC should be handled completely (i.e all the registers
should read 0 at least once) and only then is a new MSI IRQ guaranteed
to be recognized by the wrapper.

During debug without this commit, I often saw that DWC level MSI bit was
set (and IRQ status in endpoint's register was also set) but wrapper
level MSI bit was not set and host CPU never received an interrupt
therefore causing endpoint drivers to timeout waiting for certain events.

I am not sure how these fixes can be relevant to my problem.
