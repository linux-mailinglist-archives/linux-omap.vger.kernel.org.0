I think adding 100us more is not required since as you said and as also 
mentioned in CEM spec, 100ms covers for both power rails and refclock to
get stable and 2 consecutive sleep call looks different to me.
But if still required (please let me know), will do the suggested 
change, along with other fixes you asked below.

sure will change variable name to perst_gpiod.

yes gpiod_get shouldn't be optional, will fix this too.
