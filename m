Hi Rob,
sorry for the delay. I wanted to wait for v5.5-rc1 and it did take =
longer...

Yes.

The boards are examples I can test, but any board with the same SoC =
should work.
I have added "Example: " in front of all these comments.

Well, there are hints that they exist but there is no good documentation
about it. This means that at the moment the user-space must be able to
identify the correct blobs that are to be used for a specific SoC. And
we need different variants compiled as .ko and loaded on demand.

The first one is also used to match different .ko builds from the same
source tree with different macro definitions for the individual SoC.

It may be possible that we end up in a more generic driver that only =
matches
on one of the second to fourth compatible record, and asks runtime API =
about
the SoC, but at the moment this does not exist.

The fourth one is intended to be able distinguish between sgx5 and sgx6.

I also found that I have not defined it in most of the device tree =
patches.

But yes, we can drop it since AFAIK there are no activities for sgx6.
And if they start, we can update bindings and boards.

It differs depending on the integration of the SoC. OMAP does not need
any clock defintions on the gpu node (clocks are handled by sysc parent)
while JZ4780 needs one (at least in the v3.18 vendor kernel with working
SGX).
