True. Sometimes allyesconfig for given arch might be helpful but not
always (e.g. for ARM it does not select all of ARMv4 and ARMv5 boards).
Most likely your approach is actually faster/more reliable.

This is neither Rob's nor Greg's patch to pick up, but ARM SoC (which was
not CCed here). And most likely they won't pick it up because judging by
contents it is obvious it should go via ARM SoC.

Sure, if there are dependencies between some patches they can go with
acks through unrelated trees, but this not the usual way. This is an
exception in the process to solve particular dependency problem.  It has
drawbacks - increases the chances of annoying conflicts.

The case here does not fall into this criteria - there is no dependency
of this patch on the others  Therefore there is no reason to use the
unusual/exceptional way of handling patches.  There is no reason why
this shouldn't go via either specific ARM subarchitecture maintainers or
via ARM SoC.

Looks good.
