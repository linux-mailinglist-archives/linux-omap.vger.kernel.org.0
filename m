OK interesting, I did not know those registers are not accessible
on 3503.

As there are possibly multiple omap3 variants used on the same
boards, we need to rely on the runtime detection of the SoC.
So yeah soc_device_attribute is the way to go here.

I don't recall any similar issues booting 3703 but it's been a while
so worth testing for sure.

Tony
