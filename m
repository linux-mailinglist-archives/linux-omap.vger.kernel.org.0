It may make no difference to you, but it does for me, as I'm the lucky
idiot reviewing this code. So I am going to say it again: please keep
anything that only exists for the PRU subsystem benefit out of the
initial patches.

I want to see something that works for Linux, and only for Linux. Once
we have that working, we'll see to add more stuff. But stop throwing
the PRU business into the early patches, as all you are achieving is
to delay the whole thing.

It means that interrupts declared in DT get their two-level routing
via the kernel driver, while PRU interrupts get their routing via some
external blob that Linux is not in control of?

If so, this looks broken. What if you get a resource allocation
conflict because the kernel and the blob are stepping into each
other's toes? Why should an end-point client decide on the routing of
the interrupt?

All the end-point should provide is the ID of the input signal, and to
which PRU this is routed. Interrupts described in DT should have the
exact same model (input signal, target). All the intermediate routing
logic should be handled by the Linux driver for *all* interrupts in
the system.

And that's fine. Just push *all* of it into Linux, and not just the
programming of the registers.

It obviously isn't the same at the moment. You have two distinct code
paths, two ways to describe a mapping, and a potential resource
allocation issue.
