You are using a "proper" non-standard usb micro-b cable that grounds
the id pin, right?

If not, try with one of those as it allows the hardware to do what it's
supposed to do.

And presumably you don't have a hacked usb hub that feeds back the
vbus to your phone, right?

If you have, that should not be used as the pmic can feed vbus.

Tony
