Hmm oh so this is against my earlier RFC patches. Care to respin
the series against v5.6-rc?

Feel free tweak my patches to leave out the unnecessary stuff as we
decided to do things in a better way :) Just add a note like:

[spinal: dropped out unusable foo and bar]

So we know what got changed compared to the RFC patches.

And then we might have a nice working set for merging in subject
to others approving this approach of course :)

Regards,

Tony
