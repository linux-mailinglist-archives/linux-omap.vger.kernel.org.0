No, it can do much more than that. It's a framework to control the SoCs pow=
er
domains, so clocks might be a part of it, but most of the time it's going t=
o be
about powering up a particular device.

I'm really not sure what makes you think that this should be modelled as a
clock?

This is what we done for the Mali. The devicetree binding was first done fo=
r the
out-of-tree driver, and then lima/panfrost reused it.

The key thing here is to have enough confidence about how the hardware work=
s so
that you can accurately describe it.
