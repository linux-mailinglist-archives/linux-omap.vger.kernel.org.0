Hi Laurent,

Sorry it took awhile for me to get back to this.

Can you try throwing around fw_devlink_pause/resume() around the
of_platform_populate() call in arch/arm/mach-omap2/pdata-quirks.c?
Just trying to verify the cause/fix.

If it fixes the issue, then considering Rob's comments [1], a good
short term solution might be to have the suggestion above and some way
to do pause/resume only when the top level devices are added.

As you said, the complexity of fw_devlink parsing can be O(N^2). There
are other ways to improve it to make it O(N) but it has a bunch of
additional complexity and memory increase. When I tried to do it that
way the first time, I was question whether O(N^2) actually translated
to measurable difference. Looks like we do now :) I have something in
mind for how to do it with O(N) complexity, but I expect it to take a
while to get in. So in the meantime, I'm thinking of using
fw_devlink_pause/resume() as a short term optimization.
