Some of the cpufreq drivers don't use dev_pm_opp_of_register_em() but 
instead em_register_perf_domain() with their em_data_callback [1].
It is because of point 2. described above. The dev_pm_opp_of_register_em
won't work for them, so it's not a good candidate to cover all use cases
in the framework.

Sure, I will only split patch 1/5 as you suggested and send v6.
Thank you for your time and help.
