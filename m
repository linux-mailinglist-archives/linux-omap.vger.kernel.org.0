the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a 
key bullish trend line with support near $43,500 on the hourly 
chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could

$42,600 level. A low is formed near $42,664 and the price is now 
consolidating losses. An immediate resistance is near the $43,450 
level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent 
decline from the $45,900 high to $42,664 low. The first major

moving average. The next key resistance is near the $44,250 
level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent 
decline from the $45,900 high to $42,664 low. Source: BTCUSD on
