But what about nand-controller.yaml? This driver is just about
emulating what a NAND controller would do with GPIOs, any NAND chip can
be wired, no?

Not really, it's just the controller part? I know for years
NAND controllers, ECC engines and NAND chips have been considered a
single hardware entity, but I believe this one is just about emulating
the host controller part.

I kind of disagree here, this "piece of software" only replaces a NAND
controller. You always need a NAND chip in front of it, and that's a
specific piece of hardware anyway. Or maybe I don't understand the
hardware behind? (truly not impossible)

This is definitely a host controller parameter. Even if the hardware
only supports a single NAND chip, I believe it should be described as a
subnode with a dummy "reg =3D <0>;" property.
