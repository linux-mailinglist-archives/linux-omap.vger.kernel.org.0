Hi,

With lowered charge voltage fixes in set "[PATCH 0/3] cpcap charger and
battery fixes", the first two patches deal with the lower voltage using
POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CONSTANT_CHARGE_VOLTAGE and make it configurable.

The third patch makes charging work for higher rates by lowering the
charge current basedon chrgcurr1 interrupts.

As far as I'm concerned, all these can easily wait for v5.5 merge window.

Regards,

Tony
