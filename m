Agree, this needs to be redefined.

Good point, I will change it into 'only for CPU devices'.

OK, I will change it to 'unsigned long priv[0];'. The argument of stall 
because of missing cpumask when we probably already missed for 'em_pd'
in the scheduler code, is good for me.

I have check some literature and indeed 'active power' is not present,
but I could find 'active energy' and 'standby energy'. So we could
use 'active power' when we are talking in context of active energy.
In some other place I found 'Operating power (dynamic + leakage)' and
'Standby power' measurements for different architectures.

So I would prefer to keep 'active_power' which would mean the power
when a device was running (active).

The functions em_cpu_get() and em_get_pd() are called only during
start phase (topology initialization or thermal setup). After that
these subsystems carry on with the returned pointer in their private
structures. So I would prefer to keep implementation clean and have all
EM structures in one list (avoiding the per-cpu).

I also had this feeling until I have checked the cpufreq_online().
In that function after a call to driver's init function, the
'related_cpus' is set, not before (based on policy->cpus).
So I think it is safe to say 'policy->cpus' here.
