Well, I was not able to understand and decode PCIe base and PCIe CEM
specs to figure out which timeout value should be used. You wrote about
T-PERST-CLK but I'm really not sure if it is this one... Therefore I
cannot say if something deviates from spec or not.

PCIe base spec does not define any standard interface for controlling
PCIe Warm Reset and PCIe CEM spec does not define any SW interface for
PERST# pin. So every board / computer with PCIe slot may connect PERST#
pin in different way to CPU. Some ARM boards connect all PERST# pins to
just one GPIO, and so via SW you can reset all PCIe cards at the same
time. No granularity to reset just one card. Some other connects all
PERST# pin to CPU reset output pin, so when CPU / board resets it cause
also reset of all PCIe cards.

I read that some server machines have some dedicated device connected to
CPU via i2c/smbus, which controls PERST# pins for each PCIe slot
individually. And on these machines people use userspace i2cset
application to control PERST# and therefore can reset cards manually.

If ACPI / BIOS / UEFI system has some kind of PCIe support && PERST# is
controller by software then for sure it needs to reset PCIe card (at
least putting it from reset state to normal) prior trying to read PCI
device/vendor ID from config space.

Are there any open source implementations? Or we are just limited to
dump ACPI bytecode or BIOS / UEFI firmware and start reverse engineering
it? Because this would not be simple.

And major problems with PCIe Warm Reset / PERST# signal I saw only on
boards where there is no BIOS / UEFI / ACPI; just native PCIe controller
drivers which talks directly to HW.

I was not able to find any way how to control PERST# on any my x86
laptop (standard setup with UEFI and ACPI). So I'm even not sure if on
x86 laptops is PERST# controllable by SW. I can imagine that this PIN
may be connected to some reset circuit from Embedded Controller which
may take full control of resetting card when it is needed at correct
time.

So it is possible that code which controls PERST# on x86 does not have
to run on CPU and may be "burned" as part of other hardware...

I'm not sure what do you mean by this 1). GPIO is set to output
direction and can be either in low or high state. One of this states
represents RESET state on PERST# pin and which it is (low or high) is
defined by DTS (reset-gpio).

So setting GPIO with output direction to value 1 (active) always puts
card into reset state and setting GPIO to value 0 (inactive) puts card
into normal state.

This is open question.
