We do get the conf and mux data separated though. This fixes the long
term complaint that the pinctrl single binding mixes conf and mux data.
And the driver can take the dtb conf values and convert them into
something generic and use more generic pinctrl functions. So I would
not call it interim binary format, it's something we'll be using in
the long term. I would also like to get to the next step that we've
been discussing, but who knows if we ever get there. Feel free to
get the ball rolling on the new generic binding, we'll be discussing
it for years as has happened with the earlier attempts :)

BTW, for more complicated use cases, we can already quite easily
create hardware specific drivers with the use of GENERIC_PINCTRL_GROUPS
and GENERIC_PINMUX_FUNCTIONS, see for example the iodelay driver at
drivers/pinctrl/ti/pinctrl-ti-iodelay.c. It uses #pinctrl-cells = 2 and
passes the timing values in two cells.

Good point. The values could be passed by increasing the value for
#pinctrl-cells and then the generic format would need to look like:

pinctrl-single,pins = <AM335X_PIN_MDC (PIN_INPUT | PIN_PULLUP)
                       1234 MUX_MODE7>;

Except we'd be setting the conf in a generic way and would avoid
potentially lots of pin specific properties.
