Hi Viresh,

I like the idea, only small comments here in the cover letter.

The EM is never freed for CPUs by design. The unregister function was
introduced for devfreq devices.

The scmi cpufreq driver uses direct EM API, which provides flexibility
and should stay as is.

Let me review the patches.
