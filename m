In subject, "Advertise ARI Forwarding Supported".

It's not obvious that "AFS" refers to ARI Forwarding Supported, and
the bit name is enough; we don't need to know that it's in Dev Cap 2.
"Advertise" shows that we're just *advertising* the functionality, not
*enabling* it.

By "ARIFwd bit" here, I assume you mean PCI_EXP_DEVCAP2_ARI in the Root
Port?  Maybe you can use the #define to make this more greppable.

s/funciton/function/ (twice)

If we don't enumerate function numbers greater than 7, we shouldn't
have pci_dev structs for them, so why are there later read/write
config accesses to them?

If the Root Port doesn't advertise ARI Forwarding Supported,
bridge->ari_enabled will not be set, and we shouldn't even try to
enumerate functions greater than 7.  So it's not that enumeration
*fails*; it just doesn't happen at all.

Is the SERROR when scanning under PCIe0 or under PCIe1?

I'm not clear on what's happening here:

  1) Root Port advertises PCI_EXP_DEVCAP2_ARI, we set
     bridge->ari_enabled and scan functions > 7, we do a config read
     to function 8, get a UR response (as expected during enumeration)
     and that results in SERROR?

  2) Root Port *doesn't* advertise PCI_EXP_DEVCAP2_ARI, we don't set
     bridge->ari_enabled, so we don't try config read to function 8,
     and something blows up later?

  3) Something else?

This seems like a j721e defect; why does the workaround need to be in
the generic cadence code?
