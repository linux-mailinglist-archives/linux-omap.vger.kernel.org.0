Can you please better explain this? With example or a description
or a proposal?

I simply do not have your experience with "every other GPU" as you have.
And I admit that I can't read from your statement what we should do
to bring this topic forward.

So please make a proposal how it should be in your view.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
