Thanks for debugging the issue Kevin. It seems the issue is caused by the
extra runtime PM usage count done for modules tagged no-idle. However,
this causes issues for am335x timers as the PM coprocessor needs all
the domains idled for system suspend despite the system timers tagged
with no-idle.

We could patch ti-sysc.c for more timer workarounds, but I don't know if
that really makes sense. It would add further dependencies between the
system timer code and the interconnect code, and I'd rather go back to
no dependencies between the system timers and the interconnect code :)

So I suggest we make the omap3 gpt12 quirk checks SoC specific as below
for now, they are not needed for the other SoCs.

Then at some point we can plan on dropping support for the old beagleboard
revisions A to B4, and then reverting commit 3ff340e24c9d ("bus: ti-sysc:
Fix gpt12 system timer issue with reserved status").

Note that we now have commit 23885389dbbb ("ARM: dts: Fix timer regression
for beagleboard revision c"), so there no need to (wrongly) enable the
old timer quirks for working omap3 revision C and later boards.

Regards,

Tony

Subject: [PATCH] bus: ti-sysc: Make omap3 gpt12 quirk handling SoC
 specific

On beagleboard revisions A to B4 we need to use gpt12 as the system timer.
However, the quirk handling added for gpt12 caused a regression for system
suspend for am335x as the PM coprocessor needs the timers idled for
suspend.

Let's make the gpt12 quirk specific to omap34xx, other SoCs don't need
it. Beagleboard revisions C and later no longer need to use the gpt12
related quirk. Then at some point, if we decide to drop support for the old
beagleboard revisions A to B4, we can also drop the gpt12 related quirks
completely.
