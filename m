Yes, calling this function from userspace ends in kernel code the 
$subject patch is part of.

omap_bo_new() is fine and does not need any updates/fixes, it is the 
code that uses it (whoever it is, I am not familiar with the userspace 
you are using) that shall pass correct flags (third parameter) when 
calling it.

BTW you shall really find who and how uses OMAP BO API, in theory it 
might use ioctls directly and not call omap_bo_xxx functions. strace 
would be your friend there. or gdb, or whatever tools are used on 
android. Or put some printfs() in omap_bo_new() that output the PID of 
the calling process, etc.

There should not be any issue. The changes could be backported if one 
hits the issues this $series is fixing, but there is no need.

Hard to say without knowing what that library would be.

When I hit issues with closed blobs, sometimes I reverse-engineer them 
to fix the issue, example:

https://github.com/maemo-leste/sgx-ddk-um/tree/master/dbm

This is REed libdbm from sgx-ddk-um 1.17.4948957, that is responsible 
for allocating BOs (what omap_bo_new() does) but it uses DUMB buffers 
API, instead of OMAP BO API.

I guess you are using some older version of sgx-ddk-um, so you may fix 
in similar way. Or binary patch.

Regards,
Ivo
