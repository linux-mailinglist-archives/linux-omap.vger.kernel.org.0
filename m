What you think would be the issue?

I am not opposed to split nand-controller.yaml into
nand-controller.yaml and nand-chip.yaml if it simplifies the
description of controllers but I don't get why it would be needed. In
particular since we expect all drivers to support the

nand-controller {
	controller-props;
	nand-chip {
		chip-props;
	}
}

organization which has been enforced since at least 2018. Having a
controller vs. chip representation is fundamentally right. But here I
see how "legacy" are these bindings with so much unneeded specific "ti,"
properties... On one side it would be good to verify that the driver
supports this representation (which I believe is true) and on the other
side maybe it's time to advertise "better" bindings as well.


Thanks,
Miqu√®l
