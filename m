Certainly different compatible strings can be used as needed.
But pinctrl-single is not going to be am335x specific though :)
We have quite a few SoCs using it:

$ git grep pinctrl-single,function-mask arch/*/boot/dts/ | wc -l
41

Sure but in the long term we're better off with using #pinctrl-cells
along the lines what we have for example for #interrupt-cells and
#gpio-cells.
