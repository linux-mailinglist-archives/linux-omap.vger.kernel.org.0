Hi.

Hm. I'm getting "Permission denied" when trying to do this.
Anyway, charge_now value is not supposed to be initialized by the user.
Only charge_full should be writable.

There are two steps needed to calibrate the battery: to hit the "fully  
charged"
state and to hit "battery empty" state. When the both states were hit the  
driver
will initialize charge_full value. And it will start reporting correct  
charge_now
and capacity (battery charge percentage) values.

Once the charge_full value is calculated it's recommended to be saved by  
the user
to a permanent storage between reboots.

Saving/restoring the value can be done in init scripts.

For saving the calibration value just use the command like:
cat /sys/class/power_supply/battery/charge_full > /battery_cf

To restore (after device reboot or power on):
cat /battery_cf > /sys/class/power_supply/battery/charge_full

This will allow the kernel to do fast calibration. I.e. you will
only need to fully charge _OR_ fully discharge the battery to start
seeing correct charge_now and capacity values.

I'd prefer to have charge_full value undefined until the battery is  
calibrated.
This way the userspace can estimate current battery capacity using voltage  
as a
fallback for uncalibrated battery. The voltage estimation will be  way more
accurate than having charge_full = charge_full_design on pretty old Droid 4
batteries. For example, my battery after calibration has about 1000 mAh,
while charge_full_design is 1740000.

It's better to rely on voltage estimated percentage.
In Maemo Leste we patched upower to use the following formula, which gives  
pretty
good results:

percentage = (voltage - voltage_empty) / (voltage_full - voltage_empty) *  
100

Actually, the formula we use is a bit more complicated.

If you're curious, here's how it's actually done:
