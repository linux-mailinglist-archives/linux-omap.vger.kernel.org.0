Indeed that's what I meant by "regardless of this change".

Right, this patch is undeniably a better implementation of the existing 
approach, I just felt it worth pointing out that that approach itself 
has fundamental flaws which may or may not be relevant to some current 
and/or future users. I know for a fact that there are platforms which 
cripple their PCIe host bridge to 32-bit physical addressing but support 
having RAM above that; I don't *think* any of the ones I know of are 
using the dw_pcie driver, but hey, how much do I know? ;)
