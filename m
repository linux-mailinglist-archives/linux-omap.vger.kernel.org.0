Treating conf and mux separately is not am335x specific. Linux treats
them separately because the conf options typically can be described
in a generic way while the mux is just signal routing.

Sure the conf values are currently not generic, but that could be
done if wanted to and added some property to specify that the
controller uses generic conf values.

For SoCs using #pinctrl-cells = <2> we now have conf and mux values
separated in the dtb. Certainly that's a better place to be compared
to earlier for any further pinconf changes.

With interrupts the IRQ_TYPE flags are generic and separate from the
hardware specific cells. If we wanted to, we could have something
similar for pinctrl framework.

I don't see issues with backward compabilty. If we specify that the
controller uses #pinctrl-cells = <2>, and some additional property
for specifying generic conf flags, we'd have a similar generic binding
to the interrupt binding.
