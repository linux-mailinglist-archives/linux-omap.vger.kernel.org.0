That's probably TI specific...

Did you read .../bindings/example-schema.yaml? It explains the common
cases and what schema are doing. I recently added to it, so look at
the version in linux-next.

YAML requires spaces.

Generally only keys or values starting with '#' need quotes. There's
other cases, but we simply don't hit them with DT. We tend to quote
$ref values, but that's not strictly needed.

An 'items' list defines the order.

                                                ^^^^^^
'oneOf' is the schema keyword you are looking for.

You can't. Schemas match on a node and work down from there. So you
can do it, but it's more complicated. You'd need a custom 'select'
select that matches on the parent node having the child node you are
looking for (assuming the parent is something generic like
'simple-bus' which you can't match on). However, based on the example,
I'd say checking 'ranges' is outside the scope of schema checks.
'ranges' doesn't have to be a certain value any more than every case
of 'reg' (except maybe i2c devices with fixed addresses). It's up to
the .dts author how exactly to do address translation.

I would like to have more ranges/reg checks such as bounds checks and
overlapping addresses, but I think we'd do those with code, not
schema.

Dependencies are documented in Documentation/devicetree/writing-schema.rst.

This should have been correct with the script, but you need to drop 'bindings'.

Not valid YAML nor json-schema. Each value needs to be list item with 'const:'

Plenty of examples in bindings/arm/ with board/soc bindings.

This needs to be a new 'items' list under 'oneOf'.

Just gave up on trying to write a schema here?

For single entries, just 'maxItems: 1' is enough. Unless you have
something special about this device, you don't need a description
here.

This should be dropped. It's just for reference as you write the schema.
