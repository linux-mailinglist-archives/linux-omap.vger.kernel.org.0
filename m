Hello Bjorn,

There are multiple issues which are leading to different behavior on 
different platforms.

1. PCI_EXP_DEVCAP2_ARI is not set.

Consider scenario:
J7200 (RC) --- J721E (EP with 1 PF and 4 VFs)

PF enumerates successfully on J7200 but bringing up 4 associated VFs 
(echo 4 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<device>/sriov_numvfs) doesn't workout. 
First VF gets devfn = 6 and then +1 for next one on wards. 6 and 7 are 
setup fine but 8 and 9 fails and UR is received while accessing them. 
Accessing VFs > 7 doesn't go through the ARI support check and directly 
calls pci_setup_device(). So, since PCI_EXP_DEVCAP2_ARI is not set, 
unable to access VFs > 7.

pci_sriov_configure_simple+0x34/0x80
sriov_numvfs_store+0xa4/0x190


Same issue happens when J7200 RC is replaced by J721E PCIe0 in above 
setup but because of errata i2086 in this case, UR response results in 
SERROR too.

2. PCI_ARI_CAP_NFN field in PCI_ARI_CAP for last function is not set to 
0 which marks current function as last but instead set to current_fn+1, 
which leads to reading of vendor ID for current_fn+1 which doesn't 
exists, giving UR response.

Consider scenario:
J721E(PCIe1 as RC) ----- J721E (EP with 1PF)
PCIe1 has PCI_EXP_DEVCAP2_ARI set , so it reads the PCI_ARI_CAP_NFN 
field of EP to get the next function number, now since at last function 
(PF=0) PCI_ARI_CAP_NFN field is set to 1 and not to 0, RC tries to 
access devfn=1 , which results in UR along with SERROR because of errata 
i2086.
For this I had pushed the workaround

This register setting has to go between 
devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname(pdev, "reg") and 
cdns_pcie_start_link() which is in pcie-cadence-host.c

And this will be done only if private data field set_afs_bit is true, 
other quirks are also done in similar way.
