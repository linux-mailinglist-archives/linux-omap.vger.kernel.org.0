Subject: [PATCH 00/15] Updates for cpcap charger and battery

Hi all,

Here's a series of patches to update cpcap charger and battery support
for showing capacity. I've reorganized and cleaned up the patches posted
earlier and simplified few things in the process compared to the earlier
patches. The first few patches contain minor fixes that can wait for the
merge window no problem.

The battery capacity is only available if charge_full is written via
sysfs based on calibration, and then a battery low or high value is
seen. This follows what we already have for n900.

Regards,

Tony
