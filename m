While the patch itself is correct, this kind-of changes the behavior on
already upstreamed platforms. Previously the driver expected #PERST to
be asserted be external means (or default power-up state) and only takes
care of de-asserting the #PERST line.

There are 2 platforms that will be impacted due to this change
1) arch/arm/boot/dts/am57xx-beagle-x15-common.dtsi (has an inverter on
GPIO line)
2) arch/arm/boot/dts/am571x-idk.dts (directly connected to #PERST)

For 1), gpiod_set_value(reset, 0) will assert the PERST line due to the
inverter (and GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)
For 2), gpiod_set_value(reset, 0) will assert the PERST line because we
have GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH

So this patch should have to be accompanied with DT changes (and this
patch also breaks old DT compatibility).

Thanks
Kishon
