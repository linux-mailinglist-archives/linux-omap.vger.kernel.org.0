And the sgx544 seems to have two such clocks.

Indeed.

these should exist and be optional.

Well, they exist only as hints in block diagrams of some SoC data sheets
(so we do not know if they represent the imagination definitions) and =
the
current driver code doesn't make use of it. Still the gpu core works.

So I do not see any urgent need to add a complete list to the bindings =
now.

Unless some special SoC integration makes use of them. Then it is IMHO =
easier
to extend the bindings by a follow-up patch than now thinking about all
potential options and bloating the bindings with things we (the open =
source
community) doesn't and can't know.

My goal is to keep the bindings as minimalistic as possible. And reset =
lines
and power domains are (at least for those we have in the works) not =
needed
to make working systems.

Therefore, for clocks I also would start with a minimalistic approach =
for
a single optional GPU core clock and leave out reset and power =
completely.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
