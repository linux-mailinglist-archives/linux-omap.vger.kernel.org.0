Just a drive-by comment: The above looks like a too big of a hammer and
the wrong place to fix this.

The serdev runtime PM implementation is supposed to just work for serdev
drivers that do not want to use it, and otherwise those drivers manage
the runtime PM state of the serdev (serial) controller directly (e.g.
see c3bf40ce2c20 ("serdev: add controller runtime PM support")).

Without having time to look at this regression (or the rework) in
detail, it seems like the serial core rework has broken the serdev
runtime PM implementation if the serial controller is now suspended
without the serdev driver having asked for it.

The pm_runtime_get_sync() in serdev_device_open() is supposed to prevent
that from happening by default and if that now longer works, then that
needs to be fixed.
