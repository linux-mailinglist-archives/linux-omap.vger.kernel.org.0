Hmm I'm getting -EINVAL when I do echo 1600000 > charge_now but yet the
value does get updated?

And I'm still not seeing capacity show up after that though even with full
battery.. I think we should be able to calculate it if either a high or
low value has been seen?

Also, we should have the driver default to using the charge_full_design
value if nothing is written from userspace and we see a high or low value.

Maybe some pessimistic estimate could be used instead of just using
charge_full_design if no value is initialized from the userspace?
Something like (charge_full_design / 4) * 3 maybe?

Yes it will be off, but the driver should work also without user
interaction :)

Regards,

Tony
