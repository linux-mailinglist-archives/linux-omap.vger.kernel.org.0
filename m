The way I see this is that the flag in cpufreq avoids
mistakes potentially made by driver developer. It will automaticaly
register the *simple* EM model via dev_pm_opp_of_register_em() on behalf
of drivers (which is already done manually by drivers). The developer
would just set the flag similarly to CPUFREQ_IS_COOLING_DEV and be sure
it will register at the right time. Well tested flag approach should be
safer, easier to understand, maintain.

If there is a need for *advanced* EM model, driver developer would
have to care about all these things (order, setup-ready-structures,
fw channels, freeing, etc) while developing custom registration.
The developer won't set this flag in such case, so the core won't
try to auto register the EM for that driver.

I don't see the dependency of PM_EM on PM_OPP in this series.
