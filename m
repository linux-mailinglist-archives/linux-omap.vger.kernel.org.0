That's for the device side. But this is the host side and that consists
of two components:

     1) The actual PCIe host controller (DWC)

     2) Some hardware wrapper around #1 to glue the host controller IP
        into the TI SoC.

#1 contains a MSI message receiver unit. PCIE_MSI_INTR0_STATUS is part
that.

If there is a MSI message sent to the host then the bit which is
corresponding to the sent message (vector) is set in the status
register. If a bit is set in the status register then the host
controller raises an interrupt at its output.

Here, if I deciphered the above changelog correctly, comes the wrapper
glue #2 into play, which seems to be involved in forwarding the host
controller interrupt to the CPU's interrupt controller (GIC) and that
forwarding mechanism seems to have some issue.

The changelog is unspecific enough, so I can't explain for sure how the
wrapper hardware confuses itself.

My assumption is that after the host controller raised an interrupt at
the input of the wrapper logic the wrapper logic requires a transition
back to quiescent state before it can raise another interrupt in the
GIC. And that seems to require that all bits of PCIE_MSI_INTR0_STATUS
are cleared.

If my interpretation is correct, then the DWC side is not at fault and
it's soleley the TI specific hardware glue which makes this thing
misbehave.

Of course I might be completely wrong, but the TI folks should be able
to tell.

OTOH, what I do not understand in the patch is the reimplementation of
the interrupt chip. All functions are copies, except for the actual
register writes.

The drax version uses dw_pcie_writel_dbi() which invokes
dw_pcie_write_dbi() and that function does:

void dw_pcie_write_dbi(struct dw_pcie *pci, u32 reg, size_t size, u32 val)
{
	int ret;

	if (pci->ops->write_dbi) {
		pci->ops->write_dbi(pci, pci->dbi_base, reg, size, val);
		return;
	}

	ret = dw_pcie_write(pci->dbi_base + reg, size, val);
	if (ret)
		dev_err(pci->dev, "Write DBI address failed\n");
}

The dwc version uses dw_pcie_wr_own_conf() which does:

static int dw_pcie_wr_own_conf(struct pcie_port *pp, int where, int size,
			       u32 val)
{
	struct dw_pcie *pci;

	if (pp->ops->wr_own_conf)
		return pp->ops->wr_own_conf(pp, where, size, val);

	pci = to_dw_pcie_from_pp(pp);
	return dw_pcie_write(pci->dbi_base + where, size, val);
}

As dra7xx does neither implement pp->ops->wr_own_conf() nor
pci->ops->write_dbi. Ergo the interrupt chip is just a copy with some
obfuscation.

I might be missing some detail, but asided of the actual interrupt
service routine, this looks like a massive copy and paste orgy.

Thanks,

        tglx
