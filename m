Well in this case while you review a single function, it's usually better
to fix similar issues to avoid having to review the same function multiple
times. Of course if the patch becomes hard to read, then it makes sense
to split it into several patches.

Please just update this patch so we have _init() completely reviewed for
similar issues and is not left only partially patched.
