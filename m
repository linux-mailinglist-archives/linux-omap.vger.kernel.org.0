Something like that, yes.

It will be only a problem if McBSP is the clock provider and we need to
change to external reference clock for the BCLK/FSYNC generation. In
most board designs the codec provides the clocks - they tend to be more
flexible when it comes to clock source.

It is not the parent's fck, it is the PRCM clock which is selected as
the sourcee of the clock generator (CLKS) for BCLK/FSYNC. That is the
functional clock as well for the McBSP instance.

Out of reset it is using the PRCM source which is fine in all current users.
I would do this fix or workaround in a different way: instead of
ignoring the error, avoid it in the first place. Do nothing if the
already selected clock is requested.
That would remove the error and will fail in case the reparenting is not
working -> boards will know this and might be able to do something about
it in a reasonable way.

How that sounds?
