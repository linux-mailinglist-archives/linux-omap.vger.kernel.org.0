Yup that's standard USB OTG feature when ID pin is grounded.

Sounds like you're missing a USB micro-B cable with ID pin grounded
and trying to use debugfs/sysfs instead to force the host mode.

Yeah well.. just ground the ID pin :) No debug interface should be
needed here.

If you really wanted to add some kind of debugfs interface for forcing
host mode without ID pin grounded, you could try to have the USB phy
driver enable ID pin pull-down via sysfs. That's the cpcap PMIC in this
case, I think some combination of CPCAP_BIT_ID* bits might do the
trick.
