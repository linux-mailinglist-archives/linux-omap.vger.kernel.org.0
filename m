It doesn't seem like these patches help achieve that, since they
create device tree binaries with a property that has the same name and
number of cells, but the cells have a different meaning than above,
and must be handled differently by the driver.  So you either drop
compatibility or need to forever deal with supporting an interim
format that is being created by these patches.

The conf and max are already split in (all but one) of the device tree
SOURCE files via the macro with multiple fields.  That does seem like
a good step if you wanted to transition into something like the above.
But splitting it in the binary too doesn't help.  Is there a way the
dtb now being created can turn into the above via a driver change?
Absolutely not.  So what's the point of an interim binary format?  All
that matters is what the source looks like, and since that doesn't
change, nothing is accomplished.

I'll also point out that the current generic pinconf, done not via
flags but with multiple properties for each configurable parameter,
has a drive strength properties with strength in mA or =C2=B5A as a
parameter.  How would you do that with generic bit flags?  I don't
think you can fit everything in pinconf-generic.h into one 32 bit
cell.

But the pinctrl-single,pins isn't parsed.  It just uses the values as
they are.  You'd have to write something to parse the cells and add
more data to the dts that told the parser how to turn them into device
specific values.  It seems like that could eventually achieve
basically what is happening already with the dts preprocessor
converting symbolic constants into device specific values.
