Couldn't that happen with the current code too? alloc_page() isn't
guaranteed to be DMA'able, right?

Well, we're wasting 4K or 64K of memory and then leaking it is the
main reason to change it.

We just need any address that's not memory which PCI could access. We
could possibly just take the end of (outbound) PCI memory space. Note
that the DWC driver never sets up inbound translations, so it's all
1:1 mapping (though upstream could have some translation).
