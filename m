I don't mean that, sorry, and we can figure out if both of them are worthy to be picked up.

Right, there is some docs which need to be update or even drop, and a reorder would be a timing to push each of arch maintainer to do something, isn't it? Anyway, reordering  documents like kernel source dir could be one of choices. :)

Thanks for considering, anyway, it could be a good start to get hands dirty whether the arch dir is needed.
