Hmm sorry I somehow thought it was using a dmtimer. There are references to
ABE_GPT5_FCLK to ABE_GPT8_FCLK in the TRM but maybe those are separate
and the driver is not tinkering with the timer register directly hopefully.

OK

So I guess the ick is in the dts the ocp_abe_iclk@528 for omap4 and
abe_iclk@528 for omap5. Seems like the driver should request them, I recall
that the interconnect target module does not need the ick to access sysc
and revision registers.

Hmm the "we don't need separate target modules" patch is wrong, the modules
may have separate clocks and power domains, and flushing a posted write to
one module does not flush write to the other module. This can lead into hard
to track down bugs accessing separate modules. The dts module data I
generated from the hardware AP registers for each SoC so the module ranges
should be correct.

Yeah nice,

Tony
