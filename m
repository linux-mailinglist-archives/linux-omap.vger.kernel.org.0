It's good that it's just for fun ;)

The EM is directly used by scheduler in the hot-path, there are no
checks even if the EM if for CPUs. We are sure it's is for CPUs and
is always there for all CPUs.

I'm currently working on a EM v2 which would have stronger mechanisms
and do better job in this field. The patches are under internal review
and hopefully ready to post by the end of month.

True, it doesn't harm, so I commented it in the patch 1/8 that it
could stay.
