Perhaps in all the cases you faced, but GPIOD_OUT_HIGH [0] really means
"active", not "electrically high", and here we want reset to be
deasserted (=deactivated), not asserted (=activated).

I guess it works when the GPIO drives PERSTn without inversion (no NOT
gates or an even number of NOT gates) _and_ device tree does specify the
GPIO as active high (which is incorrect: PERSTn is active low).

Exactly for this reason a portable driver must never drive the signal
"electrically low" or "electrically high". That's why with my patch I
propose to give the proper interpretation [1] to GPIOD_OUT_HIGH, i.e.
"active", i.e. "reset asserted". Device tree will describe if active
means electrically low (no NOT gates between GPIO pin and device PERSTn
pin) or high (odd number of NOT gates).

Additionally, as per patch description, even in the cases where the
driver deasserts the reset, it does not assert it. Should the signal be
asserted before dra7xx_pcie_probe(), devm_gpiod_get_optional(dev, NULL,
GPIOD_OUT_HIGH) would not move the line and thus would not reset the device.

The only problem I can imagine with my patch is with existing code. If
you have a board with the reset GPIO described as active high in DT
while it is active low (no/even NOR gates on board), then you should
apply this patch _and_ fix the board device tree.

I hope the intent of the patch is clearer now.
