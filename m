Based on what we chatted on irc yesterday, I'd suggest try resetting the
clockevent on suspend first for am3/4 at omap_clockevent_idle() and see if
that takes care of the issue. If it's the timer hardware blocking the
deeper idle states, this should work, and GIC will lose it's context
on system suspend anyways.

If there's still a pending interrupt status blocking deeper idle
states for system suspend after clockevent reset, then maybe the related
interrupt controller(s) should clear/reset the state for context lossy
suspend for CPU_CLUSTER_PM_ENTER for system suspend.

Looks like for GIC we have gic_dist_save() being called but it does not
seem to clear anything for system suspend.

For runtime PM, we don't want to clear any pending interrupts on
CPU_CLUSTER_PM_ENTER :)

Seems like a system suspend/resume test loop should be first run to
trigger the issue and see what is still missing.

Regards,

Tony
