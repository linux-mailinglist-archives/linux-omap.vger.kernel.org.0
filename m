It's both, it allows only 32-bit aligned accesses and the size should be
only 32 bits. That's why I always use "readl" in the APIs below.

yeah.

This assumption is used elsewhere too (e.g drivers/pci/access.c). I
generally don't prefer adding handlers for non-occurring error
scenarios, but If you insist I can fix that.
