You can't make it atomic WRT both systems, but is there locking around
each RMW? Specifically, are preemption and interrupts disabled to
ensure time between a read and write are minimized? You wouldn't want
interrupts disabled during the delay too though (i.e. around
.raise_irq()).

BTW, I've asked this question before, but aren't PCI legacy interrupts
level triggered? If so, isn't generating a pulse wrong?
