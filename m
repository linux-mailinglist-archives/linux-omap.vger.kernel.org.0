AFAIR, it did not fail but emit thousands of warnings for other areas
so I may have missed some warning but there was no error that did stop
compilation.

Not that I am aware of. Your comment was:

<<<

> +    # BeagleBoard ABC, OpenPandora 600MHz

I'd expect compatibles to be per SoC, not per board.

> +      - ti,omap3-sgx530-121, img,sgx530-121, img,sgx530, img,sgx5

4 compatibles is probably a bit much. Are there not any version or=20
feature registers that some of this could be detected? If there are, I'd=20=

assume the middle 2 strings could be dropped. If not, drop the last one=20=

and just match on the 3rd string. It's not a long list.

So I interpreted your comment is about the # comment focussing too much
on boards instead of SoC and about dropping img,sgx5

Yes.

Hm. As far as I understand YAML, it has multiple ways to define the same
structure but this manifold nature has its drawbacks.

If it is wrong I have to admit that I still do not understand how to =
write
correct schemes... Why has it been made so difficult for us developers?=20=

Is this better readable?

IMHO, this would be a nice coding trick that would make this
even more unreadable and does not add any new information.

Generally, in my opinion, a bindings document should not only
satisfy the dtbs_check but should be human readable (and writeable!)
so that a DTS developer can still understand and ideally copy&paste
fragments. With such enum tricks and -items const: constructions
this IMHO becomes more difficult.

Therefore I think the linear list is better readable and
can be directly copied. If the test rig has problems with
that statement, I would suggest that the parser should be
modified to understand what we can easily write and read.

The same is for # comment vs. description: . The # comment
is for a human reader of this document to get a hint what
board the next line is intended for. It is not necessary
(and IMHO impossible) to automatically test it. So I do not
see any need to add a formal -description entry here.

I have a broader audience in mind than 'make dtbs_check'. IMHO, this
document should help future developers to get an idea what to write for
those SoC. Yes, it might not be 100% correct, but it is easier to =
correct
a 99% correct definition than inventing it from scratch after dropping
partially correct information I already have.

For example, we know from data sheets and public information that the
allwinner a83 contains a sgx544 but it is not sure if it is the -116
variant. Or, the poulsbo has a GPU called gma500 which is an sgx535. It
is only that nobody has verified this so far by real hardware.

If we leave it out and someone starts to adapt this to the poulsbo
in let's say 2 years from now, that someone has to be lucky to find
our discussion here and take that as a hint.

I am not sure how you are developing contributions, but my first
place to start with is the existing code and not the archives of
LKML.

That is my motivation adding these records right here even if they
are not verified.
