Just to make sure I'm on the same page. I thought you at least had a
device where phy_count = 1. But looks like you are saying you don't?

If all you want to check is "phys" have device links created for them
for whatever random DT device that has a "phys" property, then I can
test and confirm that for you on whatever platform I have. But if you
want a test specifically for the device that corresponds to the driver
you were fixing, then I can't. Let me know.
