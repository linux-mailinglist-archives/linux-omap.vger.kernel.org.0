Easy enough, will remove completely for v2.

The out-of-tree patches should not be used and are only for backwards
compatibility with folks who have not updated to using the proper
remoteproc/rpmsg driver for PRU. Removing this driver would normally
be a userspace break (which we should obviously avoid), but since
the ability to actually use this driver never made it fully upstream
I see no issue.

And we shouldn't try to now upstream the full usable support for this
UIO driver at this point as we have a proper kernel driver for this hardware
upstream now.

(I'd argue most of UIO should not be used as it ends up just being a
hacky way to avoid writing proper kernel drivers for hardware, but that
is a different topic :))
