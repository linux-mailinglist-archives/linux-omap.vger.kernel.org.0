For the two boards I used to maintain (Zeus and Viper), I'm happy to
see them go. Should anyone want to take over and bring them into this
decade, I'm happy to provide the HW I still have (although getting HW
was never a problem with PXA, and it probably is simply that people
have, just like I did, lost interest).

I still have a Netwinder that I switch on once in a while to check
that it is still alive (I last booted 5.18 on it, and maintain a
couple of ugly hacks to allow an old Debian to run on it). This isn't
a practical machine by any modern standard, but I'd like to keep it
around for the same reasons I still have an Alpha LCA4 (nostalgia).

Thanks,

	M.
