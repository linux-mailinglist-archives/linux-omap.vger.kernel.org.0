And the USB cable connect/disconnect is handled in interrupt -> you need
to call pm_runtime_get_sync(dmadev) from interrupt context and need to
mark the dmadev to pm_runtime_irq_safe()

the cppi41 driver solely relies on irq to check is the transfer is
completed (based on the cookie status).
So yeah, musb have no other choice than trust that the transfer is done
in a timely manner.

I think the only way to handle this is to keep the DMA enabled as long
as the USB cable is connected.
Either to introduce dma_pm_runtime_get_sync(struct dma_chan *c) and
dma_pm_runtime_put(struct dma_chan *c) or some better name.

It's use would be optional, but for USB you would call them for cable
connect the get_sync (from a work) and put it on disconnect.

The driver internally would not need to be changed, I think this patch
could be removed as well.
