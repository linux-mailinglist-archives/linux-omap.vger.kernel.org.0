Yes,

See this as an excuse for not stopping sending on demand (if any), not 
for invalid To:.
Whoever's (not) in To: of auto-submitted patches would also (not) be 
there on manual submission because the bot just emulates myself:


âžœ  linux git:(master) cat submit.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -exo pipefail

if [ "$(perl scripts/get_maintainer.pl --nogit{,-fallback} --nol "$1" 
|wc -l)" -eq 0 ]; then
         GCP=--git-chief-penguins
else
         GCP=''
fi

git send-email --confirm=never "--to=$(
         perl scripts/get_maintainer.pl $GCP --norolestats "$1" |\
         perl -pe 'if (/<(.+?)>/) { $_ = "$1\n" }' |\
         tr \\n , |\
         perl -pe 's/,$//'
)" "$@"
