Sorry I meant writing to charge_full :) Anyways, looks like echo -n works
with no errors:

# echo 1305000 > charge_full
bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
# echo -n 1305000 > charge_full

Hmm OK. So far no luck triggering that though.

OK

Thanks, I'll give the calibration another try. Maybe I did not wait low
enough, I think I went down to 3.3V.
