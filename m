nice. Well I assume it is from an era when pm_runtime did not even
existed and assumes that things are always available and react without
delay.

I had the pleasure to lurk in for the tusb6010_omap and I fully agree.

How much a pm_runtime_get_sync(dmadev) is different when it is issued by
the client driver compared to when the dma driver issues it for it's own
device?

Yes, what the cppi41 does is (was) correct. If the rpm's work is not
executed between the runtime_get and when the is_suspended flag is
checked in issue_pending, then the resume callback will start the
transfer. That's kind of fine(ish). If cppi41 would be used for audio
then it would not be as the DMA must start when we tell it to start.

Hrm, true.

But I still fail to see the difference between the events before this
patch and with the case when there is a 100ms delay between prep_sg and
issue_pending.

Before this patch:

prep_sg()
issue_pending() <- runtime_get() /  put_autosuspend()
		   _not_ starting transfer
runtime_resume() <- starts the transfer

With this patch and than 100ms delay between prep_sg and issue_pending:

prep_sg() <- runtime_get() /  put_autosuspend()
runtime_resume() <- not starting transfer
issue_pending() <- runtime_get() /  put_autosuspend()
		   starts the transfer

With this patch, but more than 100ms delay in between:

prep_sg() <- runtime_get() /  put_autosuspend()
runtime_resume() <- not starting transfer
> 100ms delay
runtime_suspend()
issue_pending() <- runtime_get() /  put_autosuspend()
		   _not_ starting transfer
runtime_resume() <- starts the transfer

pm_runtime_get_sync() in issue_pending would be the solution to avoid
delayed execution, but the usb driver should not assume that DMA is
completed as soon as issue_pending returned.
