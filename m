Well, not exactly.  I think there are some .c file changes related to
making the drivers tristate, e.g., adding .remove(), etc.  Those
specific changes and the Kconfig change from bool to tristate should
be in the same patch.

The split into two drivers should be basically a code rearrangement
that doesn't add any new functionality.  That should be in a separate
patch by itself.

These changes should be separate from the patch that splits into
host/endpoint drivers.

We should not make module unload possible until reload is reliable.
But in the meantime, we can certainly make it possible to build the
drivers as modules and load them at runtime.
