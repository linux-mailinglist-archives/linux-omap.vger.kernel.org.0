Adam, maybe check if 6.1 stable series is missing something to be
backported from this mailing list thread:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230207014207.1678715-2-saravanak@google.com/

That email thread version seemed to work for me based on my reply in the
thread. I recall issues with the earlier revisions but don't remember
what fixed them.
