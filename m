So basically you suggest first to compile the old and new dts files, then to
de-compile them, then diff old and new fdt's, and visually compare the results.
Personally it isn't that much better than what I did, since each old and new
dtbs will for sure differ due to the node names change suggested in this patch.
So it will lead to the visual debugging too, which isn't that effective. But
your approach is still more demonstrative to make sure that I didn't loose any
nodes redefinition, since in the occasion the old and new de-compiled nodes will
differ not only by the node names but with an additional old named node.

So to speak thanks for suggesting it. I'll try it to validate the proposed
changes.

Two questions:
1) Any advise of a good inliner/command to compile all dtbs at once? Of course I
can get all the updated dtsi'es, then find out all the dts'es which include
them, then directly use dtc to compile the found dts'es... On the other hand I
can just compile all dts'es, then compare old and new ones. The diff of the
non-modified dtb'es will be just empty...
2) What crosc64 is?

Why? The changes are simple and can be formatted as a single patch. I've seen
tons of patches submitted like that, accepted and then merged. What you suggest
is just much more work, which I don't see quite required.

Actually it is a fix, because the USB DT nodes should have been named with "usb"
prefix in the first place. Legacy DWC USB3 bindings didn't define the nodes
naming, but implied to be "usb"-prefixed by the USB HCD schema. The Qualcomm
DWC3 schema should have defined the sub-nodes as "dwc3@"-prefixed, which was
wrong in the first place.

Regarding automatic-pickup-stable-bot if it exists I don't think it scans all the
emails, but most likely the stable@vger.kernel.org list only or the emails
having the "Fixes:" tag. If I am wrong please give me a link to the bot sources
or refer to a doc where I can read about the way it works, to take it into
account in future commits. Just to note I submitted patches which did some fixes,
had the word "fix" in the subject but weren't selected to be backported to the
stable kernel.

Anyway I don't really care that much about the subject text using the word "fix"
or some else. So if you suggest some better alternative, I'd be glad to consider
it.
