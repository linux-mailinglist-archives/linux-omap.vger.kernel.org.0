Yes, but SoC specific defines needs to start with a SoC specific
prefix as multiple files may be included for various SoCs.

The wake_en only gets set when some driver does request_irq() on
the wakeirq. No need to set them all.

No need to set all wake_en pads, just checking that if request_irq()
is done for some pin that does not have wake_en capability does not
cause eternal interrupts if a reserved bit is high all the time :)
