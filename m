I sent a comment to the patch.

As Laurent said, I think this really should be fixed in the framework 
side. Calling detach in drivers without attach feels just plain wrong.

However, I don't see any harm in the patch (but perhaps some changes 
needed as per my comments), and it will fix the issue for omapdrm, until 
someone has the time and energy to look at a real fix.
