Then, it should belong there and not be a comment of the ti,omap*-gpu =
record.
In this way it does not seem to be a proper hardware description.

BTW: there are examples where the revision is part of the compatible =
string, even
if the (Linux) driver makes no use of it:

drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c

Yes, that is something we had planned to get rid of for a long time by =
using different compatible
strings and some variant specific struct like many others drivers are =
doing it.
But it was a to big task so nobody did start with it.

Ok, I didn't know about such registers as there is not much public =
information available.
Fair enough, there are some error reports about in different forums.

On the other hand we then must read out this register in more or less =
early initialization
stages. Even if we know this information to be static and it could be as =
simple as a list
of compatible strings in the driver.

It of course tells, but may need a translation table that needs to be =
maintained in a
different format. Basically the same what the comments show in a =
non-machine readable
format.

I just wonder why the specific version can or should not become simply =
part of the DTS
and needs this indirection.

Basically it is a matter of openness for future (driver) development and =
why it needs
careful decisions.

So in other words: I would prefer to see the comments about versions =
encoded in the device
tree binary to make it machine readable.

BR and thanks,
