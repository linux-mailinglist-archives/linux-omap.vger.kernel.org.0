For now I think I will leave it as it is. Let reviewers review all other
patches. Let's see if there are any other comments on all the patches in this
series. If there are any more comments on other patches, then while re-spinning
next revision I will keep this in mind and try to add __maybe_unused tags in
all APIs that are used later.

The idea behind splitting the patches was to get them reviewed individually as
it is quite difficult to get one big patch reviewed as explained by Jakub. And
these warnings were expected. If there are any other comments on this series, I
will try to address all of them together in next revision.

Meanwhile, Please let me know if you have any comments on other patches in this
series.
