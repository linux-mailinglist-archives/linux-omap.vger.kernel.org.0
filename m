Sure, we can deduce that from general hardware design knowledge.
But not every detail must be described in DT. Only the important
ones.

Why?

TI SoC seem to be the broadest number of available users
of sgx5xx in the past and nowadays. Others are more the exception.

So you mean that we should require a dummy clock for the omap gpu node
or did I misunderstand that?

Well, yes there is of course a clock connection between the
omap target-module and the sgx but it is IMHO pointless to
describe it because it can't and does not need to be controlled
separately.

As said the target-module is already accepted and upstream and my
proposal is to get the gpu node described there. There is simply
no need for a clocks node for the omap.

What I also assume is that developers of DTS know what they do.
So the risk that there is different semantics is IMHO very low.

If you agree I can add the clocks/clock-names property as an
optional property. This should solve omap and all others.

Now you have unhooked me... Nobody seems to know if and how DVFS can be
applied to SGX. IMHO we should bake small bread first and get initial
support into mainline.

Nikolaus
