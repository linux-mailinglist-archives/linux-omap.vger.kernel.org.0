The prcm_fck should be there in the dts for each mcbsp interconnect targe
module as "fck" alias and get's enabled/disabled when the mcbsp driver
calls runtime PM.

So maybe the description should explain that things broke as the aliases
for prcm_fck and pad_ck no longer get added.

OK so an alias is needed for that too.

That's the MCPDM_CLKCTRL pad_clks_ck alias, right? Seems like the
pad_clks_ck should be claimed by the mcpdm and mcbsp drivers if they are
used? I guess it would be for some external device use case?

So sounds like we just got lucky because of -ENOSUCHUSERS? The mcbsp works
for me, not sure how come I'm not seeing this issue, does it now only work
for the default clock source?

Do we have some other examples for devices using other type of clocking?

If the functional clock source needs to be changed, seems things
should work. The parent interconnect target module driver does not care
about the fck rate. Not sure if the clock usage count causes issues
though with reparenting, if so, sounds like reparenting needs to be
done in runtime PM suspended state to do the switch.

How about someting like below to deal with getting the fck in a bit more
future proof way:

fck_src = clk_get(mcbsp->dev, src);
if (IS_ERR(fck_src)) {
	fck_src = clk_get(mcbsp->dev->parent, "fck):
	...
}

Also sounds like we should also add the missing the aliases too like Peter
pointed out if mcbsp driver needs to reparent. But just adding the alias
will possibly cause trouble for anybody adding mcbsp support for some other
SoC variant.

To me it seems in the long run the mcbsp configurations using pad_fck
should configure it in the dts for the interconnect target module node
instead as the default clock. Then mcbsp can still look up the fck
of the parent device, and change it dynamically as needed.

Regards,

Tony
