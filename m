Hi Ulf,
users did report a strange issue that the OMAP5 based Pyra does not
shutdown if a kernel 5.10.116 is used.

Someone did a bisect and found that reverting

0d66b395210c5084c2b7324945062c1d1f95487a

resp. upstream

66c915d09b942fb3b2b0cb2f56562180901fba17

solves it.

I could now confirm that it also happens with v5.18.0.
But interestingly only on the Pyra handheld device and not
on the omap5evm (which is supported by mainline).

The symptom is:

a) without revert

root@letux:~# poweroff

[   46.917534] reboot: Power down


What I suspect is that we have multiple mmc interfaces and have
card detect wired up in the Pyra while it is ignored in the
EVM. Is it possible that __mmc_stop_host() never returns in
.shutdown_pre if card detect is set up (and potentially
shut down earlier)?

Setup of mmc is done in omap5-board-common.dtsi and omap5.dtsi.

Out Pyra has a non-upstream device tree where we use
omap5-board-common.dtsi and overwrite it by e.g.

&mmc4 { /* second (u)SD slot (SDIO capable) */
	status =3D "okay";
	vmmc-supply =3D <&ldo2_reg>;
	pinctrl-names =3D "default";
	pinctrl-0 =3D <&mmc4_pins>;
	bus-width =3D <4>;
	cd-gpios =3D <&gpio3 13 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;	/* gpio3_77 */
	wp-gpios =3D <&gpio3 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;	/* gpio3_79 */
};

But I have tried to remove the cd-gpois and wp-gpois. Or make the
mmc interface being disabled (but I may not have catched everything
in first place).

Then I added some printk to mmc_stop_host() and __mmc_stop_host().

mmc_stop_host() is not called but __mmc_stop_host() is called 4 times.
There are 4 active MMC interfaces in the Pyra - 3 for (=C2=B5)SD slots
and one for an SDIO WLAN module.

Now it looks as if 3 of them are properly teared down (two of them
seem to have host->slot.cd_irq >=3D 0) but on the fourth call
cancel_delayed_work_sync(&host->detect); does not return. This is
likely the location of the stall why we don't see a "reboot: Power down"

Any ideas?

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus

printk hack:

void __mmc_stop_host(struct mmc_host *host)
{
printk("%s 1\n", __func__);
	if (host->slot.cd_irq >=3D 0) {
printk("%s 2\n", __func__);
		mmc_gpio_set_cd_wake(host, false);
printk("%s 3\n", __func__);
		disable_irq(host->slot.cd_irq);
printk("%s 4\n", __func__);
	}

	host->rescan_disable =3D 1;
printk("%s 5\n", __func__);
	cancel_delayed_work_sync(&host->detect);
printk("%s 6\n", __func__);
}

resulting log:
