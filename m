As far as word ordering, I guess you can do whatever order you want.
MSB first would make the most sense if this was only going to be up to
64-bit. But given it could be 96, 128, ... bits, probably the least
significant word first makes sense and is easier to parse for a
variable length.

The binding schema can be something like this:

items:
  - description: Mask of channels 0-31
  - description: Mask of channels 32-63

The length is implied by the number of list items.
