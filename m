I'm not sure how this could help ;( If there were dedicated GPIO pins - then yes.
But on all Sitara SoCs the pins are multi-functional and GPIO is not a primary function.
So to use some PIN as GPIO the MUX_MODE has to be *carefully* changed - and for this DT updated.
Which, in turn, means proper pull-up/pull-down can also be configured at the same time.
And all above is static configuration - even if it involves connecting different modules to BB.

(Changing MUX_MODE from user space sounds very unsafe for me.)

Next, how it can be ensured that User space will not corrupt PIN which is not a GPIO?
Usually only set of GPIOs per bank  are really muxed out as GPIO and, right now, there is no
way to say which ones, because pinmuxing and GPIOs configurations are going through different frameworks.

Lets say request come to configure GPIO1.20 to PULLUDEN - there is no way to be sure this pin
is actually pinmuxed as GPIO and not rgmii2_td1. And everything depends on DT and User qualification.
Now this is safe - just User will not get what he wants if he misses with GPIO number.
But if GPIO driver will be allowed to go and change some pinmux - it can kill rgmii2.

Or do you have more global ideas for pinmux management?
