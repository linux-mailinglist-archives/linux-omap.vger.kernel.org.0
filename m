I'm starting to be confused by triple or more negations (asserting,
signal inverter, active low)...

In your patch is GPIO set value to 0 and Kishon wrote that GPIO set
value to 0 for those two boards assert PERST# line. Asserting PERST#
line cause endpoint PCIe card to be in reset state. And in pci-dra7xx.c
driver there is no other code which de-asserts PERST# line.

So based on all this information I deduced that your patch will cause
putting PCIe cards into reset state (forever) and therefore they would
not work.

Or do I have here some mistake?
