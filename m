I see that it is convenient to have it in kernel. I just assumed
Sebastian would not take that, because it does not _need_ to be in
kernel...

And maybe it is easier in userspace, since userspace has access to
persistent storage, so it can store detailed battery calibration
parameters? (And Gnome/Mate even does something like that, see
mate-power-statistics).

So... not my decision. Don't care too much either way. I have been
doing this in userspace, but...

What I'd like to see is some kind of indication that "this attribute
is not from hardware, kernel computed it for you" so clever userspace
can ignore it/compute it in more advanced way.

Best regards,
