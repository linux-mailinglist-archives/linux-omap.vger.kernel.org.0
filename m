Sorry, I do not get the point here.
Like you said, the code that calls omap_bo_new needs to pass OMAP_BO_SCANOU=
T,
then IMO omap_bo_new should be the best place to add the OMAP_BO_SCANOUT fl=
ag,
(like via flags =3D flags | OMAP_BO_SCANOUT), that could help avoid
missing the flag by some code,
and also avoids hacks/changes on the possible blob binaries.

Do I misunderstand somewhere?
Or is there some case that OMAP_BO_SCANOUT shouldn't be passed when
omap_bo_new is called?

Do you mean the DRM_OMAP_GEM_NEW ioctl api?
There is no place in the AOSP tree to call that except the
omap_bo_new_impl function,
which is called by the omap_bo_new and omap_bo_new_tiled functions.
The omap_bo_new should not be called with the OMAP_BO_TILED flag,
while the omap_bo_new_tiled should be called with the OMAP_BO_TILED flag

Regarding to the omap_bo_new function, there are 2 places call it in
the AOSP tree:
#1 ./external/libkmsxx/kms++/src/omap/omapframebuffer.cpp
#2 ./device/ti/beagle_x15/gpu/gralloc.am57x.so

#1 seems not used in AOSP yet, and #2 is one blob binary we do not
have the source for.

Thanks a lot for these great suggestions! Will use them when possible.

Thanks for the confirmation!
I just boot-tested with adding OMAP_BO_SCANOUT in the omap_bo_new function,
and it worked with the current 4.14, 4.19, and the mainline kernels.
# via adding line "flags =3D flags | OMAP_BO_SCANOUT" in the omap_bo_new fu=
nction.

The blob binary that calls omap_bo_new is the gralloc.am57x.so here[2]:
any suggestions with it?
# sorry, I am not able to find out how you did the reverse-engineer
work# with the dbm repository shared here,
# not sure if you could give some tutorial steps for the similar
