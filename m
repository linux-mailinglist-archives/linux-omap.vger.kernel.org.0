Sounds like your out of tree SGX patches also tinker with the BB2D module.

To me it sounds like you can just tag the new target-module@59000000 added
by this patch with status = "disabled" in your SGX patch until you have
updated the driver code.

I'm adding this patch into omap-for-v5.17/dt as for 2D acceleration there
is the etnaviv driver in the mainline kernel that should be usable to
some extent.

Tony
