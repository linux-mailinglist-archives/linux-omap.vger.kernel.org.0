Ok, so if the device is powered of at omap2_mcbsp_set_clks_src() 
we get the usage count underflow, and the counter is incremented
immediately again in the runtime put function. So things get out of balance...
I'll check Tony's fix here.

As you see in the other patches of this series,
it is a simple-audio-card with a tlv320aic3x codec
in combination with the mcbsp.
