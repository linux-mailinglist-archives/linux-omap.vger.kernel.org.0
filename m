Oh OK that looks like a nice cape :)

Hmm good point. I recall the pocketbeagle uptime being many days with
USB stopping enumerating. But yes, this is powered over USB.

Hmm not sure but don't think so, I think that information comes from
the calls from gpio-omap.c to pinctrl-single.c.

That would mean that you can also use pinctrl-single as a gp(i)o
controller in some cases with the pulls instead of gpio-omap.

No, that's a separate feature.

Yes. And ideally we'd specify the real register offset rather
than the index number for the pin also in the dts.

If that does not work for some reason, then it's best to set up a
macro to avoid confusion with figuring out the pin index rather
than look up the register offset in the TRM. But we can figure
that out once you have something working.

Right, I'm more concerned what gets put into the dts files
as that's an ABI.
