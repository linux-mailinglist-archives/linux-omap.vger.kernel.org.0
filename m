A few issues have been found with device naming for the serial core
controller port device. These issues currently mostly affect the output
for /sys/bus/serial-base/devices, but need to be also fixed to avoid
port addressing issues later on.

Changes since v2:
- Fix my email script as it had started to drop linux-serial as noted by
  Greg

- Explain why we're changing ctrl_id as requested by Greg

Changes since v1:
- Port id cannot be negative as noted by Jiri

- Controller id cannot be negative as noted by Andy

- Port name is missing the controller instance as noted by Andy

Tony Lindgren (3):
  serial: core: Controller id cannot be negative
  serial: core: Fix serial core port id to not use port->line
  serial: core: Fix serial core controller port name to show controller
    id
