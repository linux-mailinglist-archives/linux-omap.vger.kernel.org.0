AFAIK not yet. The multicolor class should be ready and it is used by some=
=20
drivers for I=B2C connected LED controllers, but if I understood Pavel=20
correctly, additional work has to be done for a gpio and/or pwm multicolor=
=20
driver. See this thread from August for example:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-leds/2530787.iFCFyWWcSu@g550jk/

The "new" attributes 'function' and 'color' attributes should cover this=20
information. IIRC those were introduced sometime before v5.4 and documentat=
ion=20
is in the leds/common.yaml binding. I don't see it in the scope of this pat=
ch=20
series, but if we would merge this warning fix first, the information is lo=
st,=20
so maybe those attributes should be added before?=20

My heuristics on that would be looking at the label and if there's a distin=
ct=20
color in it, add the color property. I could do that for all pwm LEDs known=
 to=20
the tree currently. That would be a bigger task for GPIO leds though. ;-)

Ack.

Well, I "introduced" them by converting the leds-pwm binding to yaml (not=20
merged yet), so I could as well fix the warnings then? ;-)
