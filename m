Sure, but with the dummy dai it won't....

If I understand correctly the HW setup:
McBSP2 -> CPCAP_hifi (only playback)

CPCAP_voice is the i2s clock master.
McBSP3, CPCAP_voice, MDM6600 and WL1285 are all connected together via
i2s lines.

In case of Voice call with analog mic/speaker only CPCAP_voice and
MDM6600 is used.
In case of Voice call with BT only MDM6600 and WL1285 is used (but
CPCAP_voice must provide the clocks?)
In case you would have any algorithm running on OMAP4 for the calls,
then you will have McBSP3 inserted and used between MDM6600 and
CPAC_voice/WL1285.
Similarly, if you would like to tap in and record the data from the bus
you will have McBSP3 enabled.

The simplest use cases you want to support:
A. McBSP3 <-> CPCAP_voice (playback/capture)
B. MDM6600 <-> CPCAP_voice (handset mic/speaker voice call)
C. MDM6600 <-> WL1285 (BT voice call)
D. McBSP3 <-> BT (VoIP?)

I would not bother with recording the call as you would need tom
reconfigure the McBSP playback pin (is it even possible) as input to
OMAP4, I think..

B/C is codec2codec, McBSP3 is not involved at all.
A/D is when McBSP3 is used only.

Imho this can be represented as
McBSP2: 1 port
	1.1: to CPCAP_hifi

McBSP3: 1 port, 2 endpoint
	2.1: to CPCAP_voice
	2.2: to WL1285
CPCAP: 2 ports
	hifi:	3.1: to McBSP2
	voice:	4.1: to McBSP3
		4.2: to MDM6600
MDM6600: 2 ports
	5.1: to CPAC_voice
	5.2: to WL1285
WL1285: 2 ports
	6.1: to McBSP3
	6.2: to MDM6600

The machine driver should switch between the graph links based on the
use case for the interconnected devices:
A: 2.2 <-> 4.1
B: 4.2 <-> 5.1
C: 6.2 <-> 5.1
D: 2.2 <-> 6.1

Can a generic card provide such a functionality?
In case of B/C you should not have a running stream imho.
In all cases CPCAP_voice should be able to run the clocks on i2s, even
if it is not used by the audio setup.
Not sure if you can just turn Wl1285 as master, but it is possible that
it is master, but silent when it is not used?

I'm not sure if we should span out dummy dais for endpoints within a
port. Imho the port _is_ the dai. Different endpoints might use
different TDM slots on the port (or the same slot, which makes them
exclusive).

It was for the maemo-leste.
Bringing up Gentoo will be a bit harder as I don't have wifi stuff in my

I need to try droid4-kexecboot's wifi support then.
