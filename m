My Sincere Greetings,

I am MRS. Gabrielle  Algernon; I have decided to donate what I have to
you/Churches/ Motherless babies/Less privileged/Widows' because I am
dying and diagnosed for cancer for about 2 years ago. I have been
touched by God Almighty to donate from what I have inherited from my
late husband to you for good work of God. I have asked Almighty God to
forgive me and believe he has because he is a Merciful God I will be
going in for an operation soon.

I decided to will/donate the sum of ($5.5 million Dollars) to you for
the good work of God, and also to help the motherless and less
privilege and also forth assistance of the widows. At the moment I
cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact that my
relatives (that have squandered the funds gave them for this purpose
before) are around me and my health status also. I have adjusted my
will and my lawyer is aware.

I wish you all the best and May the good Lord bless you abundantly,
and please use the funds judiciously and always extend the good work
to others.
As soon you get back to me, I shall give you info on what I need from
you then you will contact the bank and tell them I have willed those
properties to you by quoting my personal file routing and account
information. And I have also notified the bank that I am willing that
properties to you for a good, effective and prudent work. I know I
don't know you but I have been directed to do this by God Almighty.

If you are interested in carrying out this task please contact my
private email at (gabriellealgernon62@gmail.com) for more details on
this noble project of mine.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs.Gabrielle  Algernon.
