We're using this feature. Our use case is a LED at the front panel which=20
shows whether a signal is present at an input LC optical connector (DWDM=20
network stuff). Here's how we're setting it up:

https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/plugins/gitiles/CzechLight/br2-external/+/6570b571bb=
f3f53cf24ef2be3079bc282c445b9e/package/czechlight-clearfog-leds/init-leds-edf=
a.sh

I understand that the GPIO numeric namespace is racy, but it's never been a=20=

problem for us in the past 5 years since this script runs much later during=20=

boot than any driver probing.

I'll be happy to test a patch like that.

However, the GPIO in question on our board is connected to a MCP23S18, and=20=

we have a pair of these. When used in this configuration (two chips at the=20=

same SPI CS, differing by a chip-specific "HW address" on a HW level),=20
there are some impedance mismatches because it's essentially two=20
independent pinctrl instances on the same SPI address. This causes=20
problems, e.g. the debugfs pinctrl instance won't be created for the second=20=

chip because of a naming conflict. We also carry this out-of-tree patch to=20=

make the GPIO labels work when set from DTS:

adcba1dadb78b66b1.1551966077.git.jan.kundrat@cesnet.cz/

(Feedback on how to solve that problem is welcome, btw.)

Since I am not that much familiar with pinctrl/gpio stuff in kernel, I=20
wanted to bring this up to make sure that your future trigger works even on=20=

a setup like ours. Here's how it's used via DTS in case it's relevant:

tsi#151

With kind regards,
