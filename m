This logic looks to be correct.

Exactly! I agree with you. And it has to be specified in DTS correctly
(or ACPI or whatever is used).

I'm still confused by sentence "gpiod_set_value(reset, 0) will assert
the PERST line" written by Kishon as you wrote that: 0 == deassert...

So I will wait for a new patch with comments and hopefully Kishon either
review that new patch is correct or find out if there is an issue
(either in some DTS file or driver code).
