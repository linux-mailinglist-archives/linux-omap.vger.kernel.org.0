I am not a GPIO expert and I have a feeling this is platform specific
beyond what the PCI specification can actually define architecturally.

There are two things I'd like to see:

1) If Linus can have a look at the GPIO bits in this thread that would
   definitely help clarify any pending controversy
2) Kishon to test on *existing* platforms and confirm there are no
   regressions triggered

Yes a comment would help but as I say above I am afraid this is
a platform specific set-up, ie that delay is somewhat tied to
a platform, not sure there is anything we can do.

If Linus and Kishon are happy with the approach we can merge this
patch.
