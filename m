Wondering if we may use kref instead which will check for saturation as well.

One line?

Hmm... Memory leak at error?

Do you really need this?

...and/or this?

I would split assignment to be closer to first user...

Ditto.

Hmm... Maybe use unsigned char and convert all of them to something else if needed?
