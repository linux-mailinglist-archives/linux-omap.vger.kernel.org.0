Right, only the cppi41 driver itself knows when it's idled
or not, we cannot rely on pm_runtime functions for that.

No, the dma will happen just fine no matter what the delay is.

Part of the problem here is the musb driver. It friggin
continues before checking the completion of a dma transfer!
Fixing that currently is not trivial.

We'd have to allow dma consumer driver call pm_runtime_get_sync()
on the dma device. Something similar maybe to what we have
for phy_pm_runtime_get_sync(). Or just get the device handle for
dma so the consumer can call pm_runtime_get_sync() on it.

Yeah the musb driver has a history of 14 years of issues.
I guess the logic there has been, it's usb, it can disconnect
at any time..

Not true. The cpp41 dma is doing the right thing and is not
affected by the PM runtime autosuspend delay. Otherwise USB
hard drives would not work, they can take seconds to spin up :)

The missing part here seems to be the fact that musb continues
before the dma completion is done.
