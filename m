The far future goal is to arrive at a completely open implementation,
but nobody knows how to get there. Therefore we bake smaller bread :)

step 1: get SoC integration right and stable (this is what this series =
is for)
step 2: make the open source kernel driver work with closed-source libs
step 3: write open-source replacements for user-space

Phillip has testes something on a83.
