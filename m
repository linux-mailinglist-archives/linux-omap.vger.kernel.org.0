OK yeah I like the idea of not showing anything until userspace
as configured estimated high and low values.

Hmm yeah this is now configurable and defaults to 4.2V so we
should use the confgured value. The reason we default to 4.2V
now is because we suspect that if left connected to the charger
at higher than 4.2V the battery ages faster.

OK makes sense. I guess we can assuem if both are set to the
the same number like 0 on boot, there's no estimate available.

Yes userspace is the only place that can eventually generate accurate
estimate based on battery wear, temperature etc.

Yes I like this idea. That leaves out the need for poor estimates
in the kernel.

I guess we should have the following new properties:

POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CHARGE_COUNTER_FULL
POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CHARGE_COUNTER_EMPTY

And these would be 0 on boot and then userspace can
update these based on battery data.
