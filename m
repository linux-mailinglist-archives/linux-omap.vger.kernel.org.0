Really?  Why not make struct uart_port a real struct device?

I think it's very justified, let's not paper over this whole thing by
adding a kref stuck in in the middle and trying to hook up the PM code
to it, instead of just using all of the PM logic that the driver model
already provides.

Why can't controllers be a device as well?

Let's try to work with the driver model here, not work around it, if at
all possible.  We never did a full conversion of the serial layer to the
driver core all those decades ago.  Perhaps now is the time to really do
that.
