Only by grepping the dts'es, which include the dtsi'es modified in this patch.
So your suggestion of compiling and de-compiling has been indeed relevant.

Yep, that's exactly what I meant when I said that your approach was more
demonstrative, etc.

Alas I don't. That's why to save my time of coming up with an automated solution
I did a very thorough modification making sure that each affected node isn't
updated in the corresponding dts'es and asked to test the patches out.

Anyway the approach suggested by you will indeed give us a better understanding
of my patches correctness. So I'll use it before sending v3. Thanks.

It's not that easy.) "make dtbs" will build dtbs only for enabled boards, which
first need to be enabled in the kernel config. So I'll need to have a config
with all the affected dts. The later is the same as if I just found all the
affected dts and built them one-by-one by directly calling dtc.

The current patches are easy enough for review. The last three patches of the
series is a collection of the one-type changes concerning the same type of
nodes. So reviewing them won't cause any difficulty. But I assume that's not
the main point in this discussion.

AFAIU there are another ways of merging comprehensive patches. If they get to collect
all the Acked-by tags, they could be merged in, for instance, through Greg' or Rob'
(for dts) repos, if of course they get to agree with doing that. Am I wrong?

My hope was to ask Rob or Greg to get the patches merged in when they get
to collect all the ackes, since I thought it was an option in such cases. So if
they refuse to do so I'll have no choice but to split the series up into a
smaller patches as you say.

From your perspective it wasn't an error, from mine and most likely Rob' it
was.) Anyway as I said I don't care that much about preserving the subject
wording, so what about the next one:
<arch>: <subarch>: Harmonize DWC USB3 nodes name with DT schema
?
