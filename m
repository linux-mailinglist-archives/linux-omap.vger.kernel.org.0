We want to enable runtime PM for serial port device drivers in a generic
way. To do this, we want to have the serial core layer manage the
registered serial port controllers. For runtime PM, we need a way to find
the serial ports for each serial port controller device.

The serial core manages ports. Each serial controller can have multiple
ports. As serial core has no struct device, and the serial port device
drivers have their own driver data, we cannot currently start making
use of serial core generic data easily without changing all the serial
port device drivers.

We could consider adding a serial core specific struct device. It would
be a child of the serial port device, and would allow us eventually to use
device_links to add generic runtime PM calls for example. But as the serial
core layer is not a device driver, driver specific features would need to
be added, and are probably not justified for a virtual device.

Considering the above, let's improve the serial core layer so we can
manage the serial port controllers better. Let's register the controllers
with the serial core layer in addition to the serial ports.

To find the serial ports for a controller based on struct device, let's
add a new data structure for a serial_controller. Let's add the registered
devices into a radix_tree so we can look up the controller easily even
with many controllers registered. This allows us to keep track of the
runtime PM state for each serial port controller device.

As some serial port device drivers enable runtime PM in their probe before
registering with the serial core layer, and some do not enable runtime PM
at all currently, we need check the state in the serial core layer on
uart_port_startup(). We need to also consider that a serial port device
may have multiple ports.

Initially we just want to enable runtime PM for all the serial port
controller devices. This allows us to add runtime PM calls and properly
handle any errors without a need for serial layer specific runtime PM
wrapper functions.

After this patch no functional changes for the serial port device drivers
are intended. For most cases, we just enable runtime PM and keep the
runtime PM usage count until all the serial controller ports are
unregistered. For drivers implementing runtime PM, we just keep track of
the configuration.

The serial core layer has the following use cases to deal with:

- If a serial port device driver does not implement runtime PM, the
  device state is set to active state, and the runtime PM usage count
  is kept until the last port for a device is unregistered

- If a serial port device driver implements runtime PM, the runtime PM
  usage count is kept until the last port for the device is unregistered

- If a serial port device driver implements runtime PM autosuspend,
  autosuspend is not prevented. This currently gets set only for the
  8250_omap driver to keep runtime PM working for it

For system suspend, things should be mostly detached from the runtime PM.
The serial port device drivers may call pm_runtime_force_suspend() and
pm_runtime_force_resume() as needed.

Changes since v1:

- Use kref as suggested by Andy

- Fix memory leak on error as noted by Andy

- Use use unsigned char for supports_autosuspend as suggested by Andy

- Coding style improvments as suggested by Andy
