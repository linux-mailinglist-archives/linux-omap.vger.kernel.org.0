Thanks for thaking the time to explain this in detail!

As I volounteered to write the patch, and since I'm lazy, I was going to
vote for the former solution. But to be honest the latter has some good
reason to exist as it handles the case of kernel upgrade without DT
upgrade...

My bad, this two-liner patch is growing so big. :-)
