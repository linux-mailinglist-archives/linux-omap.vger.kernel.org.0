I've seen it trigger spontaneously already around battery low
interrupt time.

Sure yeah I'll update it.

Yes there's some issue with shutdown. I think it's somehow related
to mdm6600 being powered where the poweroff gpio does not allow
device to shut down with modem powered. We could try adding a
.power_off function to the modem code to see if it helps.

Additionally I've noticed that we leave some PMIC features powered
when device is powered off without a modem consuming about 2.5mW
while powering off from Android shows power consumption in uW
range probably with only RTC being powered.
