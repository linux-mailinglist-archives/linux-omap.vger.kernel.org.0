I use usb host quite a bit with xt875, mostly to have a keyboard.
I have noted that several hubs i have don't work reliably, im not sure
why. Its possible that they use or request too mutch power from the
port as cpcap has a pretty small vbus out limit.

All my regular otg adapters work fine however.

I also have a powered hub that works quite well, its item 373697032160
