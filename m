Uhm, at time time in the night I'm not sure I can do much more than
adding a few notes on top of the commit message. I hope it helps anyway.

The PCIe PERSTn reset pin is active low and should be asserted, then
deasserted.

The current implementation only drives the pin once in "HIGH" position,
thus presumably it was intended to deassert the pin. This has two problems:

  1) it assumes the pin was asserted by other means before loading the
     driver [Note: Kishon confirmed so far]
  2) it has the wrong polarity, since "HIGH" means "active", and the pin is
     presumably configured as active low coherently with the PCIe
     convention, thus it is driven physically to 0, keeping the device
     under reset unless the pin is configured as active high.
     [Note: the curren 2 DTS files pointed to by Kishon have different
      polarities]

Fix both problems by:

  1) keeping devm_gpiod_get_optional(dev, NULL, GPIOD_OUT_HIGH) as is, but
     assuming the pin is correctly configured as "active low" this now
     becomes a reset assertion
  2) adding gpiod_set_value(reset, 0) after a delay to deassert reset
[Note: this is exactly the current idea, but with the additional need to
fix (=invert) the current polarities in DT]
