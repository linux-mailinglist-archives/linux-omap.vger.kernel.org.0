Hmm so probably these boot problems which only occur when your debug
cable is not attached?

Is there any connection with commits like this:
ARM: dts: omap36xx: using OPP1G needs to control the abb_ldo

So would the potential problem be more probable by patches like the
that one mentioned above?

Andreas
